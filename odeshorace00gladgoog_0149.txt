Of Rome, the queen of eines, by its grace
Accords to me a place

Ι In its loved choir of bards: and Envy’s claw

Less now my blood can draw.

Pierian Muse! who of the golden shell
Temperest the sharper swell,

And to mute fishes canst impart atone
Swans might be sain to own;

1s me the finger of the passer-by
In Roman minstrelsy

Have marked for lord, thou didst it: is I shine
And please, 't is wholly thine.

ODE IV

'THE VICTORY OF DRUSUS

OVE sor the princeos birds decreed,
And carrier of his thunder too,
The bird whom golden Ganymede
Τοο well for trusty agent knew,

Him youth and native spirit stirred,
Unripe for toil‚ to quit his nest ;

And vernal winds provoked the bird
His strength in cloudless heaven to test.
