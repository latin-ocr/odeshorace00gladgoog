olavi] rna onas or uonnca 87

This· age, so rich in crime, on marriage bed,
On kin, and homes, its filth hath shed:
This is the fount, to this we owe

The ills that land and solk o'erflow.

The ripening virgin now delights to learn
Ionic dances ; she will burn,

Well taught by art and trick to move,
From head to foot for lawless love.

χ Α wise, she seeks some youthful gallant's arms,
Her husband drowned in wine: her'charms
At random given, to none denied,
None, whom extinguished lights may hide.

Anon, and while her husband conscious lies,
Some man of cash will have her rise,

Some captain osa ship from Spain,

Who buys disgrace, and pays amain.

The race that dyed with Punic blood the seaS,
They never sprang from stocks like these,
That strong Antiochus o’erthrew,

That Hannibal and Pyrrhus slew.

No: rustics brave a manful seed beheld,
Expert the wood their arms had felled
To fetch at their strict mother’s nod,
Or eleave with Sabine spade the clod,
