ODE XV

TO AUGUSTUS

F conquering wars 't was my desire
To sing; but Phoebus with his lyre
Rebuked me, lest my little bark should be
Too slight lor that Tyrrhenian sea.

Thine era, Caesar, hath restored
Crops to our fields: to Jove our Lord

FlagS, from proud Parthian pillars which we tore;
And, wars extinct, hath shut the door

Os Roman Janus; and a yoke
For licence‚ that its bands had broke‚

ln measured order found; and crime subdued;
And arts of famous eld renewed.

Italian might, and Latium’s name
By these to an imperial fame .
Ι And majesty 'upgrewt far forth they run
From eastern to the western sun.

No lorce, till Caesar’s rule shall cease‚
Nor civil rage shall banish Peace:

Nor passion, swift at forging swords for war,
Shall set our sister towns to jar.
