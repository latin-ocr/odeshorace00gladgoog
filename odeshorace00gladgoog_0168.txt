Onu XIV] THE ODES OF HORACE 147

So Claudius that barbarian host
Of mailed men with might o’erthrew,
His triumph gained that nothing eost,
And van and rearward fiercely slew.

But thine the armies, omens, all,

And grace of gods. For, from the* day
Of suppliant Alexandria’s fall,

When town and harbour open lay,

Thy prosperous fortune, once begun,
Through three long lustres victory gave,
“ All praise upon thy triumphs won,
All glory that thy soul could crave.

Cantabrians thee, before untamed,
Thee migrant Scythian, Indian, Mede
Own for Hesperia's bulwark famed,
And queenly Rome’s defence indeed.

Thee Nile that hides his fountain-head,
Thee hurrying Tigris, Ister thee,

And, by remotest Britain spread,
Th’ obstreperous monster-breeding sea,

Thee Spain, with all her stalwart brood,
Thee Gaul obeyS, that knows not sear:
Sigambrians thee, that thirst for blood,
Pile shields and targets to revere.
