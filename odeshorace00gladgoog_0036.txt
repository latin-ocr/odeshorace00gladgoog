In shady tracts of Helicon,
On Pindus, icy Haemus on,
Where Minstrel Orpheus by his skill

Moved woods at will.

His mother’s art he deftly learned,

Quick winds and arrowy rivers turned,

And from his lyre melodious strokes
Gave ears to oaks.

First comes the Parent’s¹ classic praise,
Who seas, and earth, and seasons sways,
And the vast All, with sovereign ken

' O'er gods and men.

From him than his no higher worth,

Nor like, nor second, issues sorth;

Yet great Minerva nearest mounts,
And honours counts.

Thou, Liber, bold to strike the blow;

Thou, maid, ol savage beasts the foe:

Thou, Phoebus, of th' unerring dart,
Shalt bear thy'part.

Alcides too; and Leda's twain

For horse and fist their praise shall gain.

Soon as those silver stars have shone
On sailors lone,

¹ The Parent’s. Here only Jupiter is described in Horace
by this word; which Ι have thought it well to preserve.
