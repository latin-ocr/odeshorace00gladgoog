ODE XVIII

PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE

Ο ceilingS, wrought in ivory or gold,
Within my house behold,

No beams Hymettian here, on columns pressed
In sarthest Afric dressed.

No Attalus chose me his home to own
As heir, albeit unknown;

No well-born maidens, my poor doors within,
, Laconian purples spin.

My wits abound, mine honour I support,
Me poor the rich men court. ψ

I dun not heav’n for more, my craving ends,
Nor wony 1 my friends

Though potent, sor new gists, content to own
My Sabine sarm alone. “

Tomorrow treads upon ‚to-day ; the moon,
New now, will dwindle soon.

New contracts sor new marbles thou dost make,
But thou art near thy wake.

Thou build’st afresh, unheeding of the tomb ;
Throw’st back, for wider room,

¹ Those rippled banks by the soft Baian sea,

Not wide enough Ior thee.
