THE ODES OF HORACE

ODE XII

το nnossonl:

OFUL girls! who neither may

[ooox 111

Wash in wine their cares away,

Nor in loving gambols play,
Or they hear some uncle scold
Till their blood runs icy eold.

Citherea's winged son
Thieving thy wool-basket won,
And thy care for toil was done

With the web that Hebrus stole,
Liparaean‚ beauty's soul.

Not Bellerophon would try
On the horse with him to vie:
Runner, boner, none so high:
See him too in Tiber’s wave
His anointed shoulders lavel

, Neobule! his the art,

When the herds aroused stan,
Stags to pierce with ssying dart:
Or to strike the boar as quiclz,¹

Sculking where the woods are thick. '
