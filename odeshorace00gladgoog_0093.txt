72 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 11

...n-

The monning Bosporus to espy,
Î™ will th' Icarian ssight ouffly,
A bird of song, the Syrtes pass,
And farthest fields os Boreas.

Dacia, that masks her sear os Rome,
Colchian, and sar Gelonian home,

Who dwells in Spain, who drinks of Rhone.
Shall know me, and my fame shall own.

So let mine empty funeral show

Nor plaint, nor dirge, nor moaning know:
Dispense with sutile noise3 and save*

All idle honours os the grave.
