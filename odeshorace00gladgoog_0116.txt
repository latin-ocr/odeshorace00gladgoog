onim] nnn ones on nonncn 95

One, worthy of the nuptial ssame,

One put her pen‘ured sire to shame,

But one alone: consign her name
To deathless fame!

Her youthful lord she warns ‘Arise

Lest sleep eternal seal thine eyes

Sent whence thou know'st not: soil my sire,
And sistens dire:

‘Each, as a lioness that preys
On calves, her doom-struck husband slays:
But I nor strike thee, nor detain

In captive’s chain.

‘Let cruel setters be my sate

For mercy to my hapless mate ;

Let sar· Numidian home be mine
Beyond the brine:

‘While night and Venus aid, and wind
O speed thee: be the omens kind:
And on my tomb a pitying word

Of love record?
