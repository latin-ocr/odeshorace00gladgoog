140 THE onss os HORACE [Boon 1v

And moulder, dark Oblivion’s prey.
Thou hasta soul for high affairs,

Art formed to hold unchanged thy way,
When Fortune smiles, or Fortune scates.

Ο scourge os greed and trick, Ο freed

“ From Money's all-absorbing sway,

Wh0, whensoe’er the State had need,
No consul of the year or day,

Took'st not the useful for the good,
Flung’st back the guilty gift with scorn,
Through adverse hosts along thy way
In Virtue’s arms triumphant borne.

Not him wilt thou sor happy bless,

Whose goods are large. Far happier he,
Who shall for wisdom’s use possess

The bounties that the gods decree.

And pinching poverty can bear,

And baseness more than death can dread.
For love of friends or countrys care,

That man will gladly give his head.
