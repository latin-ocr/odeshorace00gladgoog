ou Jusrrcr

HE just man, in his purpose strong,
No madding crowd can bend to wrong. -

The forceful tyrant's brow and word,
Rude Auster, fickle Adria's lord,

His firm-set spirit cannot move,

Nor the great hand of thundering jove.
On him all searless would be hurled
The ruins of a crumbling world.

So errant Hercules did rise,

And Pollux, to the blazing skies;
Near whom reclined Augustus sips
The nectar with empurpled lips

So tigers, evil to subdue,

Thee, father Bacchus, upwards drew;
So, borne by liery steeds of Mars
Quirinus hell itsels unbars.

Juno‚ the assenting gods among,
Spalre thuS, ‘That dame os alien tongue,

That Judge befooled by Fate and Lust,
Have shattered llion into dust ;
