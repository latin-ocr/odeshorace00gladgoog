THE ODES OF HORACE 153

For whom unscathed through Troy ablaze
The good Aeneas cleared the ways,

And freed them, and, of home bereft,
Yet gave them more than all they left.

Obedient youth, ye Gods! and pure,
And peace for tranquil age assure:
Wealth, offspring, every gift and grace
Shower down on this Romulean race.

The high-born prince (that fells his foe,
But spares the victim once laid low.)
Of Venus and the Anchisean line,
Now slays for you the milk-white hine.

The Mede e’en now by sea and land
Dreads Alban axe, and Roman hand;
Scythian, and Indian, proud of late,
Ask, and our answer suppliant wait.

Faith, Peace, that Shame our fathers knew
And Honour‚ walk our streets anew;
Neglect no longer Virtue chills,

And her rich horn kind Plenty fills. Ἴ

The Seer, by all the Muses crowned,
Whose splendent bow sheds glory round ;
Phoebus, whose kind remedial art

To sichening limbs can health impart,
