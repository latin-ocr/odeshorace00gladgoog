114 THE ODES OF HORACE [BooxIII

But see Orion sink and set;
How threatens Hadria's darlding bay
Ι knoW, and how the western wet
111 tricks can play.

We leave to wives and sons of foes
The dark sea’s murmur, and the roar,
The stir when rising Auster blow5,
And smites the shore.

So, wh'en Europa trusting gave
The treacherous bull her snowy side,
Sea monsters, and the boundless wave
Tamed all her pride.

At dawn she culled the flowers afield‚
To weave the Nymphs a coronal,
But night the stars and seas revealed,

And those were all.

‘O Father'-when the flood she crossed‚
And hundred-citied Crete espied—
ίΟ daughter’s name and duty lost,’
She maddening cried;

‘Whence? Whither? ah, the wakened sense
01 sin! One death sor virgin’s guilt
Were small. Or has mine innocence
But fancies built?
