ODEXXVH] THE ODES OF HORACE 31

ODE XXVI

TO THE MUSES

HE Muses' friend, I cast aside
To wanton winds and Cretic tide
My tears and woes; 't is nought to me
Who Iords it o’er the icy sea

Or wherefore Tiridates quakes.

But, Muse of infant springs, who makes
The sun-fed ssowers for Lamia twine?
Who weaves the wreath for Lamia mine?

My strains are nought, apart from thee,
PimpleaI With thy sisters, see

That those fresh Lesbian strings resound,
And Lamia's name with praise be crowned.

ODE XXVII

A BANQUET

HE goblets, bom for ends of joy,
Let Thracians for their frays employ:
We spurn the savage use; and more, ·
Our Bacchus ne'er shaII reek with gore.

With wine and lights would rudely jar
The ssash of Median scimitar.

Have done, I pray, with impious noise,
And on your elbows rest, my boys!
