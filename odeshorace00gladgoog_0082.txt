oni xm] THE opas or HORAcE 61

And damned arts and jugglirlgs all:
He planted thee on my estate,

Thee, trunk accursed, thee, doomed to fall
Athwart thy luckless owner’s pate.

From day to day what risks to shun
Who knows? The Punic seamen dread
The Bosporus; but recl< of none
That other seas about them spread.

Rome lears the llying Parthian’s plan,
Parthia the Roman's prison-chain ;

But Death's unlooked·lor stroke o'er man
Hath triumph gained, and yet will gain. ,

Proserpine's kingdom wrapped in gloom,
The blessed in their distant ring,
King Aeacus delivering doom,
And Sappho, with Aeolian string,

A That chides her girls, l nearly saw:
Alcaeus t00, with golden quill,
That did his mournful picture draw;
Ship’s‚ war’s‚ and exile's endless ill.

¹ The Shades drank in each poet's word
ln silence meet for sacred strain‚
But dearer to the common herd
Are tales ol war and tyrants slain.
