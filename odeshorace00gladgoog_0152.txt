‘Then, as on Algidus the oak
Pruned by the biting axe anew,

From wounds, from deaths, lrom every stroke
Resource and freshening vigour drew.

‘No fiercer portent Thebes despoiled

Or Colchis: not the Hydra when
Alcides, rankling to be foiled,

Saw the lopped limbs grow quick again.

‘Drown it in floods, more fair 't will rise ;
Do battle, it will overthrow

With echoing same thy victories‚
And plunge expectant dames in woe.

‘No more lrom me of vaunting tales ;
’Tis past3 all hope hath perished, all ς

The fortune of my nation saiIS, ·
lt died with dying Asdrubal!

These Claudian hands shall nothing lack.
Jove's care shall all ill chances bar,
Wise counsel shall discern the track,
’ And speed them through the straits of war.
