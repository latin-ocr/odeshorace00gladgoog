Nor impious Carthage, burned by him who bore
His well-earned name from Afric’s conquered shore-
None more avails than our Calabrian Muse.

ll History fail, good deeds their guerdon lose.
But for our voice, if niggardly it were,

How would the son of Mars and Ilia farei

How Aeacus, whom might of minstrels rare,
Their grace, their favour, saved from the abyss?
Men worthy praise the Muse from dying srees,
And plants in heaven. So sturdy Hercules

Sits at the feasts on high by Jove's decrees:

So Leda’s twins, brightshining, at their beck

Olt have delivered stricken barks from wreck:
And so, with vine-clad brows, doth Bacchus bless
His votary’s prayer, and bring it to su'ccess.

ΤΟ LOLLIUS

HINK not these words are doomed to die
Which, wedded to the tuneful string,
With newborn arts os minstrelsy
From sounding Aufidus l sing.

Is Homer on the throne be set, ,
Stesichorus is stately still,

Alcaeus brave ς and Pindar yet,
And Cean song their places fill.
