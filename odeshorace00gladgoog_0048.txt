Famine‚ and plague, and tearful war,
Moved by your prayer, from Rome asar
Let him, our Caesar still alive,

On Persians and on Britons drive.

ODE XXII

1y pausa oa LALAGE

IF whole in life, and free from sin,
Man needs no Mourish bow, nor dart,
Nor quiver, canying death within

By poison's art.

’ Though frowning Caucasus he treads,
And boiling Syrtes hath defied,
Been, Fuscus, where Hydaspes spreads
His mythic tide.

In Sabine woodS, and fancy-free,
A wolf observed my wandering tread ;
Unarmed, 1 sang os Lalage ;

He sau, and ssed.

Such portent in the oaken grove,

Hath martial Daunia never known ;

Nor Juba's land, where lions rove
The thirsty zone.
