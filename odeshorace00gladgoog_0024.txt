OnnH] THE ODES OF HORACE

ODE ΙΙ

ΤΟ AUGUSTUS

NOUGH, Ο Sire, thine hailstorms swell,
Thy snow descends; thy red right hand
Hath smit the holy citadel,
And sear hath seized the Roman land;

Yea, all the lands‚ lest portent new
The signs of Pyrrha's age sulfil,
His herd of seals when Proteus drew

To bask upon the topmost hill.

The elm·tree top to fishy kinds,
Os old the dove's familiar nest,

Gave harbour ; while the trembling hinds
The plunging waters strove to breast.

We saw when golden Tiber stood
Back-holden on his Tuscan shore,

And then on Vesta's sane his flood
And Numa's palace fiercely bore.

He brags of vengeance‚ to requite
His Ilia's well-lamented woes‚
Uxorious river! and despite
Os J0ve his lestward bank o'erssows.
