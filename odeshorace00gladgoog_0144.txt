ΤΟ VENUS

HE feud, at rest for many a day,
Why stir anew? Have done, Ι pray.
Ι arn not now the man, Ι ween,
Ι was when Cinara was Queen.

Fierce mother of soft Cupids‚ why

To bend rough limbs at fifty, try

In flexure lithe? Betake thee, where
Youth calls thee back with coaxing prayer.

Far better, in thy swan-borne rides
Where Paulus Maximus abideS,

Go revel: and engender heat

Within some [rame whose age is meet.

For noble he, and nobly trained,

A speaker hold for men arraigned ;
A youth with hundred gifts supplied
To bear thy trophies sar and wide.
