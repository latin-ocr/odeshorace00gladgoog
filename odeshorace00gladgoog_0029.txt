Lise's narrow space forbids to frame
large hopes. Thee too the night

Will vex, thee many a fabled sprite,

Thee Pluto’s cribbing cell: and thou,

’ arriving there at last,

No more shalt rule the feast, by cast

Os dice, no more wilt gaze on forms
whose tender beauties move

At once to wonder and to love¹.

ODE V

ro marsal

HAT scented stripling, Pyrrha, woos thee now,
ln pleasant grotto, all with roses fair?
For whom those auburn tresses bindest thou
With simple care?

run 0st shar he tnne altered sarth bewan, ‘

His altered gods: and his unwonted gaze
f Shall watch the waters darkening to the gale
ln wild amare:

Who now believing gloats on golden charms;
Who hopes thee ever void, and ever kind;
Nor knows thy changeful heart, nor the alarms
Os changeful wind.
