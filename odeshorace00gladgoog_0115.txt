Like three-year fillies pasturing wide,

She skips and plays, all touch denied,

Α maid whose age not yet allows
The exacting spouse.

Thee tigers and thee woods obeyed
And followed, and swist streams were stayed;
Gate-keeper Cerberus, huge to see,

Was coaxed by thee,

Whose Furyhead doth bear a wreath

Of hundred snakes, and noisome breath

From out the three-tongued mouth doth pour, ’
And filthy gore.

Then Tityus and Ixion smiled

Ungainly; and, by thee beguiled,

The Danaids with the empty cask
Forgot their task.

The crime, the doom let Lyde leam

of guilty damsels; how the urn

Ran void ol water, and their late
But certain fate,

Which follows guilt‚ aye down in hell.
Those godless-who of worse could tell?
They dared to murder each her lord

’ With stroke of sword.
