OnnVII] THE ODES OF HORACE 89

‘Tells how nigh, through guilty dame
(Silly Proetos won

Cruel plot of blood to sranie),

Slander’s breath had done to death

Chaste Bellerophon.

Tells ol PeleuS, how he ssed
From Hippolyte,
Nearly numbered with the dead:
t All that leads to passion’s deedS,
Many an artlul plea.

Deaser than Icarian seaS,

He doth nothing care.
Thou, lest young Enipeus please‚
Please too much, so near to touch

And to vieW, beware.

Though along the Martian course
None like him can ride,
None can wheel the fiery horse,
Nor can swim to match with hirn
Down the Tiber's tide,

N ightly shut thy door ; nor gaze
When the pipes are shrill:

He will scold thy prudish ways ;

Scorn to hear, and persevere

Hard, and harder still.
