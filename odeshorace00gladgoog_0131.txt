110 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 111

An heir of future same, be bold

To curb this ¹licence uncontrolled: '
We hated Virtue which we knew
But laud it when removed from view.

Unless the scourge 0'ertake the fault,
Our sorry whinings limp and halt;
And laws are vain when morals err.
Do they from torrid tracts deter

Or lands, where Boreas takes his birth,
And frozen snows congeal the earth?
O’h all, their course our merchants urge,
And shipmen's art defies the surge.

All things, but shame, we can endure,
And one shame only, to be poor:
We dare, we suffer day by day,

But flinch from Virtue’s arduous way.

Quick‚ to the Capitolian height,

As shouts and favouring crowds invite ;
Or,¹ if indeed our crimes we mourn,
The nearest sea will serve the turn.

‘Quich thither send our woes untold,

JeweIS, and gems, and poisoned gold:
Then‚ for we somewhat still require,

Root out the seeds os ill desire.
