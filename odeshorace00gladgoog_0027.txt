Nor south-west wind at war with north,
Nor headlong Notus blustering forth,
Like whom no tyrant Adria sways

xThe tempest to allay or raise.

All forms of death will he defy
Who views rude waves with tearless eye,

Sea-monsters, and thy deadly sweep,
Thou sheer Acroceraunian steep.

Os purpose Heaven by severing main
Divided lands; but all in vain

ls rebel ships, in Heaven's despite,
May leap the waves, and lands unite.

For men, o'erbold to do and dare,
Right down the heavenly barners tear,
And Japhet’s race, portentous birth,
By guilty theft bring fire to earth.

That crime achieved, a strange anay

Of FeverS, and unknown Decay,

Swept down on man, and Death persorce ·
Made speedier his appointed course.

The might of Hercules destroyed
Hell's ba'rs, and in the airy void

With lawless wings, not given to man,
The ssight of Daedalus began.
