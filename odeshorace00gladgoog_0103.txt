THE ODES OF HORACE [Book 111

Your counsels calm you give, and given
Repent not. One there liveS, we know,

Who, froin the skies with lightning riven,
The Titans and their host laid low.

Who the dull earth and tossing main
Alone directs with even sway;

Whom cities here, and realms of pain,
Whoni gods and tribes of men obey.

E'en jove a mighty terror knew

When, strong osam, those Titans met,
Exulting with the brethren who

Would Pelion on Olympus set.

Porphyrion in stature vast,
Typhoeus and strong Mimas, sailed;
Enceladus, so bold to cast

η Huge trunkS, and Rhoetus nought availed.

For Pallas carne, her aegis rung;
Came Vulcan‚ Juno's queenly might,
Audon Apollo’s shoulders hung
His shasts, and bow sor ever bright,

The Delian and ‘Patarean king
Who laves in fresh Castalian dew
His lockS, and holds, with sheltering wing,

Those Lycian brakes his childhood knew.
