OnnXl] THE ODES OF HORACE 141

ODE X

TO LIGURINUS

STRONG in gifts ol love, yet cruel still,
When winter, all unsought, thy pride shall kill,
When locks no more about thy shoulders play,
And hues, that beat the roses, fade away ;
Thou, Ligurinus, changed to rugged face,
Shalt cry, when told by mirrors thy disgrace,
‘Why had my boyhood not mine age’s flame,
Or else mine age those youthful cheeks the same?’

ODE Xl

TO PHYLLIS

Ι HAVE a cask of Alban wine,
Phyllis, that counts its years at nine,
And parsley in my gardengrounds

For garlands. Ivy too abounds

To deck thy shining tresses, Gleams
Mine house with plate. Mine altar seemS,
While vervain chaste around it lies,

To crave its lamb lor sacrifice.

All hands are busy. Boy and girl,
They run, they jostle. See the curl
From tips os quivering flame arise,
And dusky smoke affront the skies.
