76 THE onus or HORACE [soon 111

'T is sweet for native land to die,
'T is noble: Death takes them that lly:
For coward back it has no ruth,
Nor spares the llight ol dastard youth.

To Virtue shame is all unknown;
She shines with honours os her own;
Nor, as the public smile or frown,
Takes office up, or lays it down.

By paths unknown she cleaves the sky,
And lifts the souls too great to die ;

She spurns, on pinions upward bound,
The vulger crowd, the spongy ground.

And trusty silence earns its mite.
One, Ceres, blabs thy sacred rite:
No common roos lor him with me,
No common bark to tempt the sea!

N eglected, jove oft smites good men
Mixed with the guilty herd: but when
Did Doom, though lame, not bide its time
To clutch the nape ol sculking crime?
