26 ¹arra oues or HORACEN [aooxr

Dear Knight MaecenaS, let the banks
Of thine own stream repeat those thanlrS,
And echoing Vatican again

Renew the strain.

Calenian wines are pressed for thee
And Caecuban ; for such as me,

Falernum, and the Formian hill·
No beakers fill.

ODE XXI

THE DELIAN GODS

E tender maids, of Dian tell,

Ye youths commend the Cynthian well,
And both Latona, who from J0ve
Hath all the strength of all his love.

Tell of her joy in streams and groveS,
How on cool Algidus she loves

The sombre wood ; how pleased hath seen
Dark ErymanthuS, Cragus green.

Nor leSS‚ ye youths, of Tempe's worth,
Delos, that gave Apollo birth,

The quiver to his shoulder brought,
And lyre his brother Hermes wrought.
