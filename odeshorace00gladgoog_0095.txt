74 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 111

The sword hangs bare o'er impious wrong;
Ferit, Sicilian cates will lael(

Their dainty flavour, nor shall song
Of bird or lyre bn'ng slumber back.

The gentle sleep‚ that rustics know,
By choice frequents the humble c0t;
Sweet Tempe's vale, where Zephyrs blow,
, And shaded banks disdaining not.

Tempestuous seas need not appal
The measured craving of the wise;
Arcturus verging to his fall,
Or Kid·star at his gloomy rise.

The vineyards by the hailstorm caught,
The blasted erup, the trees that swim
In ssoods‚ the scorching starS, are nought,

Or winters pitileSS, to him.

Their realm is less, the fishes think,
When buildings in the sea they spy,

Contractors' gangs their concrete sink,
The landlord keenly watching by.

But F ears and Threats can clamber fast
As lords of land: in wealth’s despite
On beaked yacht sits Care aghast‚
And rides behind the mounted knight.
