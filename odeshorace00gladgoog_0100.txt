Onalll] THE ODES OF HORACE , 79

‘With dread renown pushed far and wide,
Yea widest, where the severing tide

Parts Europe from the southern shores
And llooding Nile the field restores;

‘Still spurning gold, sor gold is best
Unfound, within the earth at rest,
Not beat for human use and gain,
And hands that holy things profane.

‘Their arms shall touch Earth's farthest bound;
Shall dare to search all lands around,

Where gathered clouds and rains to meet,
Where track the regions parched with beat

‘For warlike Rome 't is thus loretold.
But so, that, neither overbold
Nor overfond, she be not sain
To rear ancestral Troy again.

‘No: Troy, reborn with omens ill,
Her cup of woe again shall fill,

For Ι, Jove's sister and his wife,
Will lead the host to wage the stris .

‘Thrice Phoebus, build thy brazen wall;
Thrice by mine Argives it shall sall;
The captive matron thrice, forlorn,

Her husband and her boys shall mourn.'
