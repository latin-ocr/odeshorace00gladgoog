ΟΝ GLYCERA

HE tyrant mother of the Cupids twain,
The son of Theban Semele,

And random senses, all agree

To snare my soul in quitted loves again;

1 burn for Glycera, gleaming white,

Than Parian marble purer bright:

Her froward charm inssames me t00,

’ And sace, ah! perilous to view.

In me, not Cyprus now, all Venus lies:
Of aught but her Ι may not sing,
May not sor Scythian touch the string,

Or Parthian, boldest when his charger ssies—
Bring me fresh turs, then, servants mine,
Bring boughs, bring bowl os last year's wine,
And frankincense ; nor all in vain ·;

She will relent, the Victim slain.

ODE XX

TO MAECENAS

HEAP Sabine wine, in modest cup,
Corne, drink with me. Ι sealed it up
When gathered Rome would have thee hear
Its rapturous cheer.
