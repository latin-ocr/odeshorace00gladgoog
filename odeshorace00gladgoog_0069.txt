ODE ΙΙΙ

i λ ro nennius

N even mind in days os care,
And in thy days of joy to bear
A chastened mood, remember: why?
'T is, Dellius, that thou hast to die.

Alike, ir all thy life be sad,

Or festal season lind thee glad,
On the lone turs at ease recline,
And quali thy best Falernian wine.

Why do tell pine and poplar white

To weave their friendly shade delight?
This ssitting stream, why hath it sped
So headlong down its wandering bed?

Bring wine, bring persumeS, bring fresh flowers Ι
Of roses, all too brief their hoursl

While purse, and age, and Sisters Three

Permit, though dark their threads may be.

This home, these glades, no longer thine, Α
Which auburn Tiber lapS, resign;

Resign the towering heaps of gold,

Which one thine heir, not thou, shall hold.
