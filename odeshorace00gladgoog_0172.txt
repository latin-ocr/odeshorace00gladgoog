CARMEN SAECULARE

«νβ-..-

PHOEBUS, and Dian, sylvan queen,
T'win glory of the heavenly sheen,
Adored of right and always, hear

And grant my prayer this sacred year;

When, bidden hythe Sibyl verse,

Chaste youths and chosen maids rehearse
Praise to those god5‚ and worship done,
Whose grace the sevenfold hills have won.

Thou shap’st the day by eve and morn,

The same and yet another born,

Kind Sun; and from thy shining dome
Nought mayst thou see more great than Rome.

Lucina, Genitalis thou,

Or Eilithuia, favour now

Our mothers: help to bring aright
Ripe healthful issue into light.
