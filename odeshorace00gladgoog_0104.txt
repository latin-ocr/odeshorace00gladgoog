Brute might may rush in headlong course,

But tempered strength the gods make strong
And stronger‚ while they hate the soree

That madly stirs to deeds os wrong.

Let hundred-handed Gyas bear
Me witness; let Orion, who

To force Diana’s sels would dare,
But whom the virgin's arrow slew.

Barth, on her monster children cast,
Their doom in lurid hell deplores ;
Despite that inner fiery blast,
Huge Aetna's mass unbroken soars.

The vulture tortures still the lust
ι Of Tityus with devouring pains,
And for his sin Pirithous must
Still hopeless bear three hundred chains

OVE'S thunder proves for heaven his reign:
On earth Augustus shall be crowned
A god, who unto Rome’s domain
Hath Britain and the plaguy Persian bound.
