oon-nr] THE onns or nornen 81

Secur'e lrom viper's tooth l lay,

And bears: wrapped, not by mortal hand,
ln myrtle and in hallowed bay:

A charmed life, by heaven's command.

Yours, MuseS, yours, on Sabine hill
Or cool Praeneste to abide,

Or Tibur's slope, or where ye will,
Transparent Baian waves beside.

Your springs, your choirs: me, swom to these,
Philippi’s rout and conquering soe,

Nor damned trunk, nor Sikel seas
And Palinure, have laid me low.

My shallop shall, with you at hand,
The wild Symplegades explore,
My feet shall tread the burning sand
That lies along th' Assyriam shore.

Ye Britons at the stranger chale,
Ye Spaniards drink of horses’ blood:
l'll visit all both sound and sale,
Gelonian bowmen, Scythian llood.

Great Caesar, when he llies [τοττι toil—
The home his wearied warriors crave. ν “
Once ¹given them on Italian soil-
Seeks rest in your Pierian cave.
