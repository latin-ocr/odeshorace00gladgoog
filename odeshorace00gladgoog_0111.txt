90 THE ODES OF HORACE [Book 111

ODE VIII

TO MAECENAS

‘ ARCH'S Kalends, single life:
FlowerS, and fragrant censer; why?
These, you think, are all at strife ;
Coals, t00, on the grass-plot Iie.’

Thou, in either ¹tongue adept,
See my goat, to Bacchus vowed,
For the tree, that on me swept,
Nearly gave me to my shroud.

Year by year this day shall burst
Th’ amphm’s seal, and taste the juice,

Under Consul Tullus first
Seasoned in the smoke for use.

Quaff, MaecenaS, cups a score,

Burn the torches till the day,
, s Rescued Flaccus finds the store:
Wrath and uproar, off 1 away!

Banish thou thy cares for Rome:
Dacian Cotiso is lost;
Mad with woful broils at home,
Medes their Median swords have crossed.
