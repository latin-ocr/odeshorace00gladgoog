For me, let Neptune's temple-wall declare
How, sale-escaped, in votive offering,
My dripping garments own, suspended there,
Him OceanKing.

ODEVI

TO AGRIPPA ·

ET Varius bird of Homer's wing,
Thy might, thy' feals, Agrippa, sing,

Each deed achieved by Roman hand,
When led by thee, -on flood or land.

Achilles and his stubborn mood,
Or Pelops with that savage brood,
Or dark Ulysses o'er the sea

To track, is not for such as me.

Small themes, small men. My blush, the Muse
That sways the lyre os peace, refuse

Thy praise, and noble Caesar's farne, ’

For scant os worthy gift, to maim.

Diomed, by Pallas taught to thrust

At gods, or Merion black with dust
Of Troy, or Mars in coat os mail

To sing aright what bards avail¹l .

¹ ln this stanza, which was extremely difficult to compress
l abridge Meriones aster the manner os Diomed, and use both

dissyllabieally.
