ODEXIII] THE ODES OF HORACE 97

ODE XIII

TO THE FOUNTAIN OF BANDUSIA

F OUNTAIN meet for flowers and wine,
Bandusia, more than mirror bright,
A kid tomorrow shaII be thine
Whose sorehead augurs Iove's delight,

And battIe's, by the bursting horn;
But vainIy: ere the sun be high,
His blood, although so wanton-born,
Thy cooling streams with red shaII dye. η

Thee never doth the Dog·star strike
At fiereest: to plough-wearied ox

Thy cooI, refreshing touch aIike
Thou lendest, and to ranging flock5.

Thee too with fame my Muse shall bless,
StiII singing how the ilex bends

O'er the deep-hoIIowed eave’s reees5,
From whence thy babbling stream descendo
