120 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 111

She bides, ’t is well. But is she stirs
One feather, Ι her gifts resign;

Ι don my Virtue's robe, not hers,
And claim undowered Worth for mine.

ΙΙ groans the mast, when rude south-West
Blows hard, not Ι with paltry prayers
Will truckle; or will bargain, lest
My Cyprian and my Tyrian wares

Add riches to the greedy deep.

Por me through worst Aegean swell
Shall Leda's twins their vigil keep,

And my small skiff shall guard me well.

ODE XXX

AN EPILOGUE

*OW have Ι reared a monument

more durable than bras&

And one that doth the royal scale
of pyramids surpass,

Nor shall defeated Aquilo
destroy, nor soaking rain,

Nor yet the countless tide of yearS,
nor seasons in their train.
