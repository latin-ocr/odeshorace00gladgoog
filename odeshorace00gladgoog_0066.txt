ODE I

TO ASINIUS POLLIO

HE War, its causes faults, and states

That from Metellus Consul dates;
Grim Fortune's jest ; the pregnant pacts
Or chiess; arms dyed with bloody acts

Not yet avenged ; these themes supply
A stake where danger loads the die;
Insidious ashes thinly sheath,

Along thy road, the fires beneath.

Thy stately tragic Muse may shun

The stage awhile. Thy labour done,
Th' Athenian buskin, in its room,

And the high gift thou wilt resume. '

Pollio, in Court and Senate great,
Prop os th' arraigned, and of the State
Those bays th' Illyrian triumph gave
Are trophies that outlive the grave.
