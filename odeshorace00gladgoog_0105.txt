One served with Crassus:¹ yet he ties

His lot to a barbarian wife,

Wretchl and, Oh, sight for Senate's eyes!
With loes sor kin will close in arms his lis .

Apulians, Marsians, serve the Mede;
Our name, our sacred shields, forget,
Nor gath, nor deathless Vesta heed,
And all while Jove and Rome are standing yet.

'T was this that Regulus loreknew,
And spurned the foul condition ; lest
The future such example rue,
Our captive soldiers must as captives rest.

ι ’Τ was thus he spake. ‘These eyes have seen
Our standands hung in Punic fane,

And swords, that Roman once had been,
From unresisting legions vilely ta'en;

‘Have seen the arms of Romans bound
On backs once free: seen gates unbarred
For passage, and a harvest found
On fields our bands had once with ruin scarred.

‘Will the repurchased soldier dare
As once he dared? Add not the lie
To acted crime. Can wool repair ·
The colours that it lost, when soaked with dye?
