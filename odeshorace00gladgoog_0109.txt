Till evening suns the lengthening shadows' cast,
The wearied steerS, set sree at last,

And bring the genia} hour, when Light,

The car departing, yields to Night.

Age cankers all things: so our grandsires’ time
Bequeathed us one more ripe in crime;

Our sires did worse again beget,

And we shall yield the basest yet.

HY these tears, Asterie?
Earliest breeze of spring
Him, with Thynian wares to see,
Him, the youth, unmatched in truth,
Back to thee will bring,

Gyges, Him wild Goat·stars vexed,
Far as Oricum
Drove him blustering Notus next:

· Sleepless nightS, and cold that bites
All his limbs benumb.

Then from one, his hostess pale,
Couched in subtle tone
Tempts his ear a crafty tale:

‘Chloe sighS, and Chloe dies,
Dies for thee alone?
