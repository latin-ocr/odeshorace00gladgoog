Omt XV] THE ODES OF HORACE 99

Let musical Neaera’s hair
Be gathered in myrrhbreathing knot:
If keepers stop thy way, forbear

And quit the spot.

My taste sor srays provoked amiss
Grey hairs have purged: my youth’s hot morn,
With Plancus Consul, wrongs like this

Would not have borne.

ODE XV

το chamus, A chotha

IFE of Ibycus the poor,

Play thy knavish tricks no more:
All thy plots new scandal make,
Thou art near thy funeral wake.
Cease to sport with girls at all,
Cast not o'er the stars a pall.
What may fit for Pholoe,
Need not, Chloris, fit with thee,
She a Thyad’s part espouseS,
Whom the beaten timbrel rouses;
Dwellings of the youth she storms.
To her passion she conformS,
And, by love for N othus bid,
Capers like a wanton kid.
