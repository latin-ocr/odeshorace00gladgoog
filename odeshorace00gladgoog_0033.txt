12 Ι THE ODES OF HORACE [Boorl

Sculks, as in Troy's sad close, so legends run,
The seaborn Thetis hid her son,

Lest manhood’s garb should urge him lorth, to slay Ι
The Lycian bandS, before his day.

ΤΟ THALIARCHUS

EHOLD Soracte, white with snow,
lts laden woods are bending low,
Keen lrost arrests the river's llow;

Men, ThaliarchuS, melt the cold.

Heap sreely logs upon the lire.
Nay, more and better l desire,
And from that Sabine jar require
lts wine, that reckons four years old.

The rest is Heav’n's: which can at will
Bid all the battling winds be still
Upon the seething main; until

Nor veteran ash nor cypress quake.

Pry not, the morrow’s chance to learn:

Set down to gain whatever turn

The wheel may take. Youth must not spurn
Sweet loves, nor yet the dance forsake,

While grudging Age thy prime shall spare.
The Plain, the SquareS, be now thy care,
And loungeS, dear at nightlall‚ where

By concert love may whisper ‘Histl'
