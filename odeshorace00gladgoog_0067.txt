46 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 11

To-day the threatening trumpet's bray

Ι Grates on mine ear; the horns t0·day
Are rattling, and the ssash of arms ἵ
Pale knights and startled steeds alarms

Ι seem to hear those sons os same,

To see them, soiled, but not with shame;
See all that dwells on earth subdued,
Save Cato’s never-yielding mood.

Juno, that once, with all her band,
Fled from her Afrie's helples's land, ’
Hath now the vietors' grandsons made
An offering to Jugurtha's shade.

What plain but, sat with Latian blood,
By funeral mounds our impious feud

Tells ; and how Rome’s disaster fills
With echoing sound far Media’s hills!

What eddying race, what stream, but knows
Our tearful war? What wave but ssows
The redder with Apulian stain?

What coast, but blushes with the stain?

Yet change not, Muse, thy jests sor gloom,
Nor tones of Cean dirge assume;

Νο; come, and in Dione's cave

I'll touch a lyre not quite so grave.
