ODE XVI

A PALINODE

AIRER than thy mother fair,
Quash at will my scurril song:
Bum it, on thy hearthstone there;
Drown it, Adria's waves among.

¹Pythian priests their frenzy lash ;

Dindymene, BacchuS, call ;
Corybantine cymbals clash;
Moody wrath outdoes them all.

Who can tame it? Raging fire,

' Seas that ¹shatter ships and drown,
Noric sword, nor Jove in ire,
Clad with thunder sweeping down?

Once PrometheuS, as they say,
Fusing this and that began ;
Mixed it up with primal clay,
Lion's might with spleen os man.

Mark, by wrath Thyestes falls:
Wrath, the cause of when and how
Towering cities sank, whose walls
Yielded to the soeman’s plough.
