Not sor thee the cittem’s pose;
Spin the wool Luceria grows,

Nor aspire to crimson rose;

Nor, old cronel when at thine ease,
Drain the wine-casks to the leeS.

ODE XVI

THE PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE

HE brazen tower, strong gates well barred,
And wakeful dogS, had sure availed,
Imprisoned Danae to guard,
And prowling ravishers had sailed.

But Jove and Venus saw, and mocked
Acrisius jailor of the maid ;

They knew the way could not be blocked,
If Jove in gold would make the raid.

Gold, mightier than the lightning stroke,
The guard can pierce, the rock can burst.
So the Greek augur's sortune broke,
By soree of bribe with ruin cursed.

King Philip clave by tools like these
All city-gateS, and sapped the throne

Of rivalS. They that plough the seaS,
Though fierce, this fascination own.
