OanXXVH] THE ODES OF HORACE 43

ODE XXXVII

THE DEATH OF CLEOPATRA

' IS time we drink, ’t is time we dance;
Ye SalianS, up! your task advance,

Adorn the couch where gods recline:

’T is time for feasting, comrades mine.

Till now, from out its ancient binn

To draw the Caecuban was sin ;

The Queen still aimed the stroke of Fate
At Rome and at the Roman Stateu

She, with her train! base, tainted herd!

She, drunk with fortune; idly stirred
With hope. The fire, that burned her sseet,

Brought back reflection to its seat.

With Mareotic wine inssamed

Her hrain grew dizzy; but was tamed,
For Caesar drove her, and she ssed,
And wore the hues of genuine dread.

> As falcon's swoop weak doves may scare,
As the keen huntsman tracks the hare
In cold Haemonia, so he came

’ To bind in chains the fateful Dame.
