ODE XXIV

TO VIRGIL

HAT bounds can Shame,can Moderation, set,
For one so dean, to yearning and regnet?
Lead thou the dirge, sor Jove, Melpomene,
Gave lyre and song to thee.

ἵ Shall then unending sleep Quintilius bind?
O bashful Shame, Ο Truth’s transparent mind,

Pure Faith and Justice, twinborn sisters dean,
Where shall ye find his peer?

What cause he left the good for sorrowing pain!

What cause to thee, my Virgil! who, in vain

Devout, hast sought him from the gods of heaven,
But he was lent, not given.

If sweetlier than Thre’i'cian Orpheus thou
Could'st touch the chord that made the forests bow,
The blood returns not to the senseless clod,

. For Mercu'ry’s stern rod,

N.

Inexorable guard of Fate's command,
Hath fast conjoined him to the spectral band.
Alackl But what the iron laws impose

By patience lighter grows.
