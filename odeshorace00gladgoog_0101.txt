80 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boox 111

But hold, my Muse. These themes require
The music of a graver lyre;

The talk os gods no more recall,

Nor whittle great things down to small.

ODE IV

THE RULE of THE MUSES

ESCEND from Heaven, and on thy llute
Be ample, Queen Calliope;
Or shouldst thou vocal st‘rains acute,
Or great Apollo's lyre, decree.

Hark! sor l hear, if madness sweet
Deeeive not: yes‚ to stray l seem

⁵ Through glade and grove, a hallowed seat,

Resreshed by genial breeze and stream.

Beyond my nurse Apulia's bound
In legend famous, me, a lad

Weary with sport‚ and slumbering found,
The doves with fresh-pulled foliage clad

On Vultur³s hill ; a marvel, blest

By all, the Bantian glades that know
Or Acherontia’s mountain nest,

Or till Forentum's mould, below.
