BOOK ΙΙΙ

ODEI·

ΟΝ MODERATION

EGONE, vile mob, Ι bar my door,

Silenee! the Muses' priest, Ι bring
My gift ; my strainS, unheard before,
To virgins and to youths Ι sing.

Kings firmly rule their subject realmS,
But over kings Jove holds the'rod ;

The Giant brood he¹ overwhelms,
And moves all Nature with his nod.

One rears more plants, in wider space;
One pleads his lineage, votes to gain

One vaunts his morals for a place,
And one his clients' longer train.

Necessity's impartial law
For every rank is still the same,
One lot for high and low to draw:
The urn hath room for every name.
