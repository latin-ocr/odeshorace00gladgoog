onzxr] THE onrs or Honncr ’ 93

Away with pride; lest Venus turn to curse,
And rope with wheel reverse:

No prude thy father gendered ; meant not thee
To play Penelope.

Though neither gift,nor force of prayer,can mend thee,
Nor lover’s paleness bend thee,

Nor that Greek girl that holds thy spouse her slave,
Yet still thy suppliants save.

Spare me! though cruel as the Moorish snake,
And hard as oaks to break,

For ssesh and blood will bear no more the strain,
Nor soak in floods of rain.

ODE XI

TO MERCURY, ΟΝ HYPERMNESTRA

HOU teacher of Amphion’s song,
That drew the very stones along,
Come, Mercury; and Cittern come,
Once spurned and dumb

But now with sevenfold chord elate, Α

And dear to laneS, and halls ol state,

Teach me some strain l may endear
To Lyde’s ear.
