Once thou art dead, once Minos on his bench
Thy doom for thee hath writ,

Birth, eloquence, devotion, nought can wrench
Thy spirit from the pit,

Torquatusi Still in Dian’s awsul bond
Hippolytus remains;

Nor from Pirithous in friendship fond,
Can Theseus break his chains.

ODE VIII

TO CENSORINUS

OBLETS and vases would I Ireely give
To thern that with me, Censorinus, live;
And tripods, prize os valiant Greeks. Nor worst
, Would be thy portion, did my store·r00ms burst
With what Parrhasius or what Scopas wrought‚
Through colours one, and one through marble taught
Or gods or men in Iikeness to present. ’
But such are not my treasures‚ nor thy bent.
Not these delights thou cravest; but sor song,
Which I can give (and name the price), dost long.
True, words on marbles graven by the State
*Grant life and breath to the departed great;
Yet neither these, nor worsted Ioes' alarms,
Nor to have baffled Hannibal in anns,
