Who can tell? Wed aubum Phyllis;
Rich may be your kin:

Could she know her royal stoek, and
Kind Penates win!

No, the girl is not descended
From the rascal crowd:

Loyal, clear os greed, she surely
Owns a mother proud.

Arms, and sace, and tapering ankles
Unreproached I gauge.

Who suspects me? Eight my lustres,
And my shield, mine age.

ou LALAor

ER neck beneath the yoke to set,
Or draw joint burdens in a pair,
Thine heiser is not ripe, nor yet
The massive bull's embraee to bear.

Her heart is in the grassy mead;

With summer, in the streams she drops
O'erjoyed the sportive calves to lead

In play beside the willow eopse.
