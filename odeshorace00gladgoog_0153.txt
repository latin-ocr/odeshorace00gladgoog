132 THE ODES OF HORACE [BooxIV

ODE V

TO AUGUSTUS

EST seed of godS, best keeper os the race
Of Romulus, thou art too long from home.
Thy word, giv'n in the Senate's holy place,
Redeem that word, and come.

Restore, good Prince, thy country's light os day,
For when thy visage dawns, like spring benign,
The hours more smoothly win their gracious way,

’ The suns more kindly shine.

When Notus blows, and envious blasts detain,
All round the circle os the rolling year,

Beyond the breadth ol the Carpathian main,
Some youth, whose home is dear;

To omens, prayerS, and vows, his mother turns
And bends her aching vision o’er the main,
With loyal longings so his country yearns
To see her prince again.

For Ceres ηοω, and Fortune, nurse the seed;
Suspicion’s breath from firm-set Honour flees;
The sale ox traverses a tranquil mead,
The sailorS, tranquil seas.
