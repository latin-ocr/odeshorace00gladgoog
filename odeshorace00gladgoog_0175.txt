THE ODES OF HORACE

If Palatinian heights he sees,

And loves; if Rome and Latium please,
May he prolong the Roman might
Through lustres neW‚ and still more bright.

And Dian, she, who builds her shrine
On Algidus and Aventine‚

To boyhood's prayer give friendly ear,
And our Fisteen benignant hear.

Home then we go, and mark-the word;
Great Jove and all the gods have heard
These voiceS, trained in hymns to raise
Apollo's and Diana’s praise.
