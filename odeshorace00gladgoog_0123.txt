102 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 111

Than rule o’er wide Mygdonia’s plains.
Much they shall want, who much demand,

'T is best, when Heaven¹ for man ordains
Enough, but with a thrifty hand.

ODE XVII

TO AELIUS LAMIA

HOU, like the elder Lamiae,
Branch ol the pristine Lamian treel
(So, Aelius, rumour runs, and so
Their annalS, os old memory, go ;)

The founder os thy stock, ’t is told,
The Formian walls possessed of old,
And ruled where lapping Liris pours
His current on Marica’s shores ;

So wide his sway. T0·m0rrow’s blast
Ol Eurus o'er those banks will cast
Vile seaweed and a cloud of leaves;
Unless the raven’s sign deceives.

Then heap dry logs, while time allows ;
To household gods discharge thy vows; v
T0·m0rrow a young porker slay,

And let thine house make holiday.

¹ Deus. One of the instances where Horace speaks of God
individually3 not, as is more usual with him, the gods col·
lectively or generally.
