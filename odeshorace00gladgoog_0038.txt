He drove the Parthian threatening Rome,
With crushing triumph to his home,
From Indian, Serian war released

The sarthest East.

His realm, this earth, srom thee he takes;
Thy weighty car Olympus shakes,
And bolts of thine reduce to dust

The groves of lust.

ODE XIII

TO LYDIA

‘ H! Telephus, his arms of wax!
Ah, Telephus his neck os rosest'
All this my spirit, Lydia, racks ;
My swelling bile rebels, opposes

Nor mind nor colour in one stay
Continue: silent tears begin
To wet my cheeks; Ι waste away,
¹ Slow fires consume me from within;

Galled, if in wine’s too boisterous joy
Thy shoulders white are rudely hit,
And bruised; or if the madding boy
Those lips he should have kissed hath bit.
