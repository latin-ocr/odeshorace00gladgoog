By Alba's lake, in citron niche,

To mock some rival mean but rich,
With conqueror's smile, sor record here
Thy marhle image he will rear.

Abundant incense shall salute

Thy nostrils; and the lyre, and llute,
And Berecynthian pipe prolong

The dear delight, with mingled song.

. Twice tender maids on all the days
And boys thy force divine shall praise ;
And thrice their feet os dainty white
ln Salian dance the earth shall sinite.

Me nothing moves; nor maid, nor boy,
Nor hope of friendship’s mutual joy;

ln bouts oswine l count not now,

Nor bind with fresh-cut flowers my br0w¹·

ODE ll

TO JULUS ANTONIUS

ΗΟ boasts to sing, as Pindar sings,
He soars by art on waxen wings:

His name shall for some glassy sea
A title be.
