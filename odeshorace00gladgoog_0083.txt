THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxll

Not strange. The hundred-headed hound
Dropped his dark ears to songs like those,
And, in the hair of Furies wound‚
Snakes had a moment of repose.

Sound can Prometheu5‚ and the sire
Of PelopS, from their pains beguile‚
Orion too of hunting tire,
While lynx and lion rest the while.

· ODE XIV

TO POSTUMUS

H! Postumus! Devotion fails
The lapse of gliding years to stay,
With wrinkled age it nought avails
Nor conjures conquering Death away.

Think not with daily hecatomb
To alter iron Pluto’s mind,

Him‚ that with rivers wrapt in gloom‚
Can Geryon huge' and Tityu5‚ bind.

Not one that crops the fruits of earth,

King‚ starveling boor who cleaves the soil,
Whatever state, whatever birth,

Can from the fateful ssood recoil.
