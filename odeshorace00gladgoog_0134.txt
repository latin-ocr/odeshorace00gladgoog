onzxxvn] THE oms oF HoRAct Ν 113

Thou in Cyprus dost preside,
‘And in MemphiS, void of snow:

Lift thy whip; on Chloe’s pride
Just one little stroke bestow.

ODE XXVII

THE RAPE OF EUROPA

ITH littered fox, and lapwing’s call,
Lanuvian wolf, and pregnant bitch
For omenS, let the impious sall
Into the ditch.

When flashing forth the arrowy snake
To fright their fiery nags is seen,
They quit the way they thought to take.
l, augur keen,

Ere yet, fore-running rain, the crow
Turn homeward to its marsh, I'll pray
The prophet raven to bestow
A smiling day.

1 bid thee, wheresoe'er thou art,
Be happy, not forgetting me:
Nor pie, to left, nor crow's quick start, ἵ
Α terror be.
