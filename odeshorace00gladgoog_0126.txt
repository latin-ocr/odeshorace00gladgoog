. OquX] THE ODES OF HORACE 105

Go, scatter roses; Ι detest
The stingy hand. See, Lycus hears
With spite our orgies; and the guest
Too fair for his decrepit years.

Thee Telephus, as Vesper fair,
The ripening Rhoda pants to win,
Thee gleaming with the clustered hair ;
For Glycera’s love Ι burn within.

ODE XX

Cubs of Gaetulian lioness!
Soon, dastard spoiler, shalt thou yield
The battlefield.

If, winding through the rival band

To seek Nearchus, she be scanned,

How sharp the match! will you, or she,
The conqueror be?

Thy nimble arrows from the sheath

Draufst thou? she sharpens grinding teeth:

Beneath the umpire’s foot the prize
Dishonoured lies;
