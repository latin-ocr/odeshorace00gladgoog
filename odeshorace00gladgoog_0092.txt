Grim Cerberus saw thy golden horn,
And wagged his tail, os anger free ;

And when thou went'st, tow'rd earth upborne,
With all his tongues he fondled thee ¹.

ODE XX

ΟΝ HIS TRANSLATION ’ΤΟ THE SKIES

Ο weak, no vulgar wing shall bear
Me, poet-bird, through upper air,
As, quitting earth for good, Ι so
Leave envy and the towns below. v

If os poor parentage Ι carne,

I, whom ‘beloved' thou deign'st to name,
Maecenas, such can never lie

ln Stygian depthS, such cannot die.

Mine under-limbs a roughened skin,
White, anda bird's, to show begin;
And downy feathers ol a wing

From fingers and from shoulder spring.

¹This Ode has some special interest as illustrating the
intermixture of traditions. Part of what is here assigned to
Bacchus belongs, and is elsewhere acknowledged by Horace
as belonging, to the legends of Apollo. So in Odes Ι. x. 6,
xxi. 12 the invention os the lyre is given to Mercury.
