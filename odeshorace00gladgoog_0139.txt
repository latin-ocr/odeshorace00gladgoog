Quiekl Neither slopes ol Aesulae,
Nor dripping Tibur always vieW,

Nor summits where by late’s deeree
Telegonus his father slew.

Redundance makes the taste too nice;

Quit tow’rs that mount so near the clouds:
Let not the City thee entice,

Her wealth, her smoke, her din ol crowds

'T is change that rich men mostly love ς
The lowly roof, and simple fare

But clean, no purple draped above,
Full ost have smoothed the brow ol care.

The heavens are hot, with Procyon's ray,
And Lion's fire; now blazes out
The sire of fair Andromeda:
The sun has scorched the land with drought.

The swain to brooks and shadowing trees
Guides drowsy sheep, and to the brakes

Silvanus haunts; the inconstant breeze
The still and silent shore lorsakes.

A statesman, how to gulde the helm,
And what to fear thou studiest

From Seres andv the Bactrian realm
Of Cyrus, and the Don's unrest.
