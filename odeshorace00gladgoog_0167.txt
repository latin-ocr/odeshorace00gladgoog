Augustus, first os princes thou,

Through every habitable zone,
Whom the Vindelic tribes, till now
Untamed, sor feats of war have known.

And those Genausi, restless race ;
Fleet Breuni: and those forts, that frown
From Alpine heights of beetling face,
Drusus for thee hath strichen down,

Time after time. Then rushed apace
The elder Nero in his might,

The giant Rhaeti oft to chase,
With omens good, in headlong ssight.

A portent in the thickest fight,
Oh with what havoc hath he slain
Those warriors, bold in freedom's right!
Like Auster’s blast upon the main.

What time the Pleiads drive the cloud;
So the opposing squadrons bleed

When through the blazing battle’s crowd
He drives his charger’s fiery speed.

So bull-formed Aufidus descends
On Daunia, past Apulian shoreS,

Then‚ swollen with rain, his barriers rendS,
And ruin o’er our harvest pours.
