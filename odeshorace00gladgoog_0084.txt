ona xv] Tua onas of HORAca 63

In vain from gory war we shrink,
And Adria's hoarse and tortured wave,
Nor breath of sickly Auster drink,
Through autumn, catering for the grave;

Visit we must the sluggish course
Os black CocytuS‚ and the cask
That faithless Danaids fill pessume,
And Sisyphus, his endless task.

Earth, home, and winsome wife, thy fate
Will have thee leave 3 and not one tree
of all, save cypress that we hate,
Ο transient lord, shall follow thee.

A worthier heir thy wine will drain,
Behind a hundred padlocks cased,
And Caecuban the pavement stain,
More meet for pontiffs guests to taste.

ODE XV

AGAINST THE ABSORPTION OF CULTIVATED
AND OPEN LANDS BY VILLAS

THESE kingly piles the acres take
Once ploughed. The ponds dug round us gain
Bounds wider than the Lucrine lake. y

For elma we plant the unwedded plane.
