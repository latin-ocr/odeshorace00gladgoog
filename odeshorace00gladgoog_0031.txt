No: me the feast, the war employs
Of maids (their nails well clipt) with boys;
Me fancy-free; or, something warm,
My playsul use does no one harm.

TO PLANCUS

AMED Rhodes, Apollo’s Delphi, Mitylene,
Or Corinth's walls, two seas between,
Thessalian Tempe, Thebes through Bacchus known,
And Ephesus I let alone.
In builded strains some only hymn thy town,
Chaste Pallas ; and the olive crown
Adoms their temples, cropped on every hand.
For Juno's praise a goodly band
Home-nursing Argos, rich Mycenae, name. .
xMe neither stubbom Sparta’s fame
Nor yet Larissa's teeming plain so moves
As Anio’s rush, Tiburtine groveS,
Those orchards, that the nimble runnels lave
Beside Albunea's echoing cave.
oft Notus whitens all the murky sky
And rain descends not from on high.
So in thy Tibur's deeper shade, or where
The comps with blazing signals glare,
Plancus, be wise; life’s woes and toils decline,
Go, drown them all in mellow wine.
From sire and Salamis when Teucer ssed,
A wreath os poplar leaves 't is said,
