24 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booirl

Who croaks os want, or warsare's toils,
Ill theme beside the wine?

Thy gist, Sire Bacchus, better far,
Or, winsome VenuS, thine.

Yet, lest we overleap the bounds
Os ¹modest use to warn,

The Centaurs mark, and Lapithae,
Their brawl of revel born. ,

Nor was the hand of Evius light
On that Sithonian crew,

What time the shadowy bounds of right
And wrong they lost frorn view,
Their greed and passion to pursue.

Not 1, [rank-heaned BassareuS,
Will thy repose invade,

Nor drag to sunlight what thou hid'st
With twinkling leafy shade. '

Be mute then, Berecynthian horn:
Lie, maddening drums, at rest

With all your train: purblind Conceit,
Brag tossing high its erest,

Prouder than pride ; and leaking F aith,
That lets the secret pase,

More limpid than a thing of glasa
