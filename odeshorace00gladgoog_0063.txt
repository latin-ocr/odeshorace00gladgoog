ODE XXXVI

non Nunmn's RETURN

OR Numida are incense, victim, song,
All to the good gods due,
Since, from Hispania's [arthest all along,
They were his guardians true.

To many a friend he brings his dear salute,

· To thee among the best ;

For twin coeval boyhoods ye compute,
Coeval manhood's vest.

Kind Lamia! Prompt thy liberal jar produce.
Denote with Cretan white

This happy day, nor spurn the Salian use,
The twinkling foot's delight.

Drink like a Thracian, Damalis! but yet
Bassus will not be beat:

Bring shortlived lilies, longlived parsley get,
And roses lor the treat.

All will make melting eyes on Damalis:

, But none her hand can grasp;

She keeps herself lor her new lover's bliss,
More lond than ivy's clasp1.

¹ This stanza is purposely sostened.
