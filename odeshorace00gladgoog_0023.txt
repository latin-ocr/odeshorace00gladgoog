rur ones or nonnos [a00x1

A trembling mariner, to brave,
ln Cyprian bark, Myrtoan wave?

Icarian lloods, south-western gale,
These, battling, turn the trader pale:
He lauds his town, his fields, his ease;
But soon refitS, and roams the seas;
For want with commerce ill agrees.

And some old Massic wine desire,
Hours stolen from the day’s entire,
With shade os arbutus for bed,
By hallowed water's tranquil head.

But more affect the camp, the war,
That mothers with its din abhor
Of trump and horn. The sportsman dares
The cold, and home and wife forbears,
When Marsian boar hath broke the snares,
Too slim, or when his trusty pack

’ The hind have scented on her track.

But ivy,.prize of culture‘s brow
With gods above us mates me now:
Me the cool grove, the bounding choir
Of Nymphs, with Satyrs grouped, inspire,
Far off the vulgar; il the lyre
Os Polyhymnia be not mute,
And is Euterpe grants the llute.
Count me for lyric minstrel thou,
„The stars to kiss my head will bow.
