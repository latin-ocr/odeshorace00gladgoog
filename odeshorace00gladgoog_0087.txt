66 THE ones of HoRAce [ooox 11

Achilles falls before his day ;

With years, Tithonus wastes away:
The coming Hour to me may grant
The very boon it bids thee want.

Those hundred ssocks, those Sikel kine
Around thee lowing, all are thine:
The neighing mare, in races tried,
Robes twice in Afric’s purple dyed,

Thine too. A little farm to use,

A faint breath of the Grecian muse,
Me loyal Fate hath so endowed,

And taught to spum the carping crowd.

ODE XVII

TO MAECENAS

HY tease me with complaints? Yes, why?
’T is not the gods’ nor my design
That thou, MaecenaS, first should die,
, O crown and prop of all that ’s mine.

r 11 early death take half my soul,
To follow should the rest be loth?
Half life is neither dear, nor whole;
The sels-same day shall end us both.
