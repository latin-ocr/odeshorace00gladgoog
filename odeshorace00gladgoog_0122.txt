OnaXVI] THE ODES OF HORACE 101

, But care with growing treasure grows,
And thirst for more. With right I dread,
Maecenas pride of knightly rows1,
Above the ranks to list my head.

Deny thyself; the gods will give

More freely. Bare, I march to find
The camp of them that sparely live,
The camp of wealth I leave behind.

Ι shine more bright with modest means ,
Than if within my bams I store

All that the Apulian tiller gleans,
And, choked with treasures, were but poor.

A crop in sure possession held,
A silver stream, a wood, if small;

Such happy share had far excelled
Ἴ All Afric’s corn-lands held in thrall.

No honey from Calabrian bees,
No Laestrygonian jars oswine

Grown ripe, no wools on Gauiish leas
Rich-pastured ; none of these are mine.

Ι suffer not the pinch of need,

And thou would'st not deny what lacks ;
Better to curb unruly greed

That so thy purse may rounder wax,

¹ The rows os equestrian seats in the theatre.
