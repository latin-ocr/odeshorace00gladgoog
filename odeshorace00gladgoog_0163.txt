142 THE ODES OF HORACE [BooxIV

But know what cause our seasting moves:
'T is April: April Venus loves:

We meet to celebrate the Ides:

That day the sacred month divides.

Ι hold this day of passing worth,
Aye, worthy as my day of birth,
For, let its earliest ray appear,
Maecenas counts another year.

Thou courtest Telephus: he ’s caught:
No prize of yours, dismiss the thought;

Caught by a damsel rich and bold,
And skilled in willing chains to hold.

Mark, Phaethon was scorched by flame,
Ambition’s towering hopes to tarne.
Winged Pegasus who scorned to bear
An earthly rider in the air,

Bids thee observe thy proper scope
Esteem as crime unlawsul hope.

Shun ill-assorted bonds And now,
Since last of all my loves art thou,

For woman wanns me never more,
Corne hither ; con my measures o’er:
Thy lovely voice its part will play,
And charm all gloomy care away.
