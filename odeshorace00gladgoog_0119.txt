ODE XIV

TO ROME

IF Caesar went srom Rome, with life

To win like Hercules his bays,

He brings from Spain and ended strife
A victors praise.

Thou wile, who lov'st no lord but one,
(Due n‘tes performed); in suppliant wreath,
Ye matrons‚ grateful for a son

Just snatched from death;

With Caesar‘s sister all come sorth ;
Α And you, each youth, each youthsul bride,
Resrain from words of little worth
That woe betide.

Nor care nor mourning shall beset

This happy day: no tumult Ι

While Caesar rules, can dread, nor yet
By soree to die.

Boy, carry nard and garlands round,
And wine that knew the Marsian war,
' That Spartacus had never found,
Though roving far.
