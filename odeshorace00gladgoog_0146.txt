ουκ 11] ran ones or nornen 125

Like mountain stream, by rainsall fed,

That bursts beyond its daily bed,

So from deep chest, disdaining bounds,
This minstrel sounds.

Apollo’s hay he needs must win,
When his bold dithyrambs begin

To vent new words, and measures pour
Unheard before.

Or of the gods, and god-born kings,

Who quenched Chimaera's flame, he sings ;

Who smothered in the blood they spilt
The Centaurs' guilt.

So Elian winners gain their place

In heaven, and, great in fight or race,

Possessed of worthier honours live
Than sculptors give.

Or some slain warrior’s bride in tears,

With praise of all his gifts, he cheers;

Strength, spirit, virtues lifted high,
Forbids to die.

It needs a swelling gale, to hear
The Theban swan in that high air.
By Tibur's dewy bank and grove

’ Ι, JuluS, rove,
