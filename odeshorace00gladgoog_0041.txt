‘What art thou bold, with Venus hovering near?
Comb out thy lockS, and in unwarlike strain ‘
Scan thou the layS, that ladies love to hear. ⁵

Within thy chamber walls go hide in vain

‘From point of Gnossian dart, from spearman’s thrust,
From din of war, lrom Ajax swift as light.

Foul, thine adulterous hair shall lie in dust.
But all too late. see, born thy race to smite,

‘Ulysses ; look on Nestor, Pylian king;
See Salaminian Teucer, StheneIOS,
Adept of war, and keen on carto spring;
That pair, who know not sear, thy path shall cross,

‘Meriones to boot ; him shalt thou know,
And more than him ; with passion all on fire, ,

And rushing far and near to find thee, lo!
The child of Tydeus, mightier than his sire.

‘And thoul As in the glen some deer that spies
The wolf descending srom a mountain spur,
Away, his sood forgot‚ loud baying {lies
So thou wilt lly, despite thy vows, to herl

‘Achilles and his angered warriors may
Hold back for Ilion its predestined hour;

But the fixed tale ol seasons brings the day
Achaian flames shall Trojan halls devour.'
