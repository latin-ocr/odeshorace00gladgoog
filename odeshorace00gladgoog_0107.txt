86 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon 111

As though from clients’ wrangling care
Some ended suit had set him sree,

For his Venafran farm, or where
Tarentum Sparta-born salutes the sea.

ODE Vl

RESTORATION OF RELIGION

HYsathers’erimes,though guiltless thou shaltrue,
Roman, till thou the sanes renew,

And care sor each neglected shrine,

And cleanse from smoke the forms divine.

Thou rulest, why? Thou to the gods dost bend.
Here all begins, here all must end.
From scorn of gods doth ever flow
On sad Hesperia heaven-sent woe.

Monaeses twice, and Pacorus's troop

Our godless charge at one fell swoop ·
Have quelled: the necklace, mean ol old,
Is now replaced with Roman gold.

Dacian and Ethiop have destroyed, almost,
Rome with her civil broils engrossed:
One leared at sea, the other’s power
More apt to drive the arrowy shower.
