THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxl

Place me, where desert wastes forbid
One tree to breathe the summer wind,

Where sogs the land and sea have hid,
With J0ve unkind;

Or, where the sun so near would be,
That none to build or dwell may dare,
Thy voice, thy smile, my Lalage,

I'll love thern there.

« ODE XXIII

ro cenot

HLO'E ssies me, as young deer
Track the dam along the hill,
Not without an idle fear
Lest the wood, the wind, may kill.

Chloe! if the spring be born,
lf its breeze just move the treeS,
lf green lizards stir the thorn,
Tremble, heart, and tremble, kneeS.

No Gaetulian lion 1,
I no tigress at thy back:

Ripe for mates, no more be shy,
Tread no more thy mother’s track.
