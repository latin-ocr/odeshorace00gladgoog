OnnXV] THE ODES OF HORACE 19

Yet race and name are but as dust.
Not painted sterns give stom-tost seamen trust.
Unless thou dare
To be the sport of storms beware.

Of old at best a weary weight,
A yeaming care and constant strain of late,
O shun the seas
That gird those glittering Cyclades,

f ODE XV

THE FALL OF TROY

HEN with his hostess Helen o'er the seas
In [dan ships the faithless shepherd sailed,
Nereus confined the winged winde, in ease
Reluctant, and the dreadsul doom unveiled.

‘Thou lead’st her to thy home, ill bodes beyond!
Whom Greece with mighty host will claim again,

Sworn man by rnan to burst thy nuptial bond
And hurl to ruin Priam's hoary reign.

‘What sweat for men and horses in the wari
Alack, what slaughter sor the Darden line!
Pallas e’en now prepares her helm and car,
Her aegis grasps, and stirs her wrath divine.
