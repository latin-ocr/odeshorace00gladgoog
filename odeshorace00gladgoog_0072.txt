Pluck not the grapes while still they grow;
In time will Autumn’s warmth select
The buncheS, and thy vineyard show
In deep and paler purples decked.

She 'll woo thee soon. What ages thee
, Will ripen her. ’T is passing now
The saucy time: and Lalage

Shall court a mate, with hardy brow.

Loved more than changesul Pholoe,
Or Chloris with the shoulder white:
F air as, reflected from the sea,
The nightly m00n; as Gyges bright,

Who if he stood the girls among,
The sharpest eye could scaree discern
What lochs were 0'er the bosom flung,
What featureS, boy's ormaiden'S, learn.

ODE VI

TO SEPTIMIUS

EPTIMIUS! wilt thou come with me
Where unsubdued the Spaniard breathes?
Or where, off Moorish coast5‚ the sea
Apulian Syrtes ever seethes?
