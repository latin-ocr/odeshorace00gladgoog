14 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxl

ODE XI

To Leucowot

H ask thou not, ’t is sin to know,
what time to me, to thee
The gods allot: Chaldean tricks
eschew, Leuconoe.
How better far to face our fate;
be other winters yet
Ordained sor us by Jove, or this
the last, now sternly set
To weary out hy fronting rocks
the ang1y Tuscan main.
True wisdom learn. Decant the wine.
Far-reaching schemes restrain.
Our span is bries. The niggard hour,
in chatting, ebbs away;
Trust nothing for to·m0rrow's sun:
make harvest of to=day.

ODE XII

TO AUGUSTUS

HAT chief, what hero, wilt thou use
Shrill pipe or lyre to chant, O muse?
What god? what name shall echoes wake,
What answer make?
