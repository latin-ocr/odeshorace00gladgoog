Ona XII] THE ODES OF HORACE¹ 59

And fetch that Lyde, varrant jade;
Her ivory lute be at her side ; ,
‚ Her hair be dressed like Spartan maid,
With comely topknot upwards tied.

’ To nnncnnns

ATE not my lyre‚ its tender suain,
With blood that wild Numantia shed
Or Hannibal, or Sikel main
With Punic slaughter crimson·red.

Hylaeus gorged with wine eschew,
Fierce Lapiths‚ and that earthborn tace
The hand of great Alcides sleW‚
And shook old Saturn’s dwelling-place,

That shining seat. Far better tell

Of Caesar’s wass in simple prose,
Maecenas! and ol kings who lell

By pride, and marched in Roman shows.

My Muse, Licymnia reigning, wills
l tell of ‘her fast-flashing eyeS,

Her honeyed songs, ¹her breast that thrills
With mutual passion’s ecstasies
