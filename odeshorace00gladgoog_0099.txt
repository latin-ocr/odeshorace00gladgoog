78 THE ones or HORACE [noox 111

‘To me and Pallas doomed a prey,

Her king and people, from the day
When salse Laomedon detained

The wage that gods by pact had gained.

‘The adulterous wife, the guest‘s disgrace
Are noised no more: no perjured race
Os Priam now by Hector's hands

Repels the fierce Achaian bandS.

‘That war is past, sprung srorn our jars.
Ι waive my wrath: I leave to Mars
The grandson, hated now no more,
His child, whom Priestess Ilia bore.

‘To mount and dwell in heavenly sheen,
To reckon in the ranks serene

Of godo to quaff the nectar's juiee;

All this Ι grant, for wonted use;

‘But only while a breadth os sea

Parts Rome from Troy. Lords let them be,
Save there, in every region blest:

Where Priam and where Paris rest,

‘Beasts must be safe to breed, and kine
To trample. Then may stand and shine
The Capitol’: and Rome impose

Stern laws on vanquished Median soes;
