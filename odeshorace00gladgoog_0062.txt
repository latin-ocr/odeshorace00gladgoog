Hope, and white-vested F aith, ah rare!
Would court thee, nor their zeal abate

If, altering garb, and shifting care,
Thou quit the mansions of the great.

The fickle herd‚ the perjured punk„
Fall off. Such friends dissolve in air,
When wine-casks to the dregs are drunk:
Too false 'an equal yoke to bear.

To farthest Britain guard the way

Of Caesar: smite the East with dread,
Before our young and fresh array,

E’en to the ruby ocean’s bed.

Woe sor our scars ; our brethren slain!
We, stubborn crew, no law revere ;

All shapes of crime our record stain.
When did our youth through holy sear

Withhold its hand? What ill eschew,
What altar spare? O would that we
Could ssesh good swords from anvil new

On Arabs and Massagetae.
