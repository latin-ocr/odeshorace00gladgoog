Ome XXIX] THE ODES OF HORACE 117

Or why withhold from us
That wine ol Bibulus,

Still lingering in its binn
My cellar's hook within?

Of Neptune be my song,

And all the Nereid throng
With tresses green¹; then fire
Thou, next, thy curved lyre‚
With great latona's praise‚
And Cynthia’s arrowy rays.

Venus, the swan-borne, she χχ

¹ Our crowning song shall be,
Whom glittering Cyclades,
Cnidos, and Paphos, please:
Then, when the hours grow dim,
Old Night shall have her hymn.

TO MAECENAS ¹

CHILD os Tuscan royalty,
A cask ne'er stirred of mellow wine,

Rose ssowers‚ and oil for hair, with me
Have long been stored, but marked as thine.
