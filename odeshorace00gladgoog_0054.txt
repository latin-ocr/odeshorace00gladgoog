onexxvm] ann onas OF Honnca 33

It boots thee nought, what thou hast wrought
Through vast supernal realrns to ssy,

And traversa all this earthly hall
In spirit: sor thou hadst to die.

From Fate's great onds, the guest of gods
And sire of Pelops could not hide;
Tithonus fair enthroned in air,
And Minos, Jove's adviser, died.

From Trojan field his dinted shield
Euphorbus may for witness call,

Yet yields his breath, aye twice, to death,
His nerves, his flesh; ¹though not his all.

Nor mean, in sooth, for quest of truth
And nature thou esteemedst him.
One path we tread, to join the dead,
And pass within the regions dim.

The Furies grant in war no scant;
· Devouring seas o'er sailors roll;
Young funerals hold their place with old ;
Proserpina spares no breathing soul.

My limbs‚ my head unburied,
Begrudge them notos shifting sand
