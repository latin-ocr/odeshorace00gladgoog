This strong Falernian must I drink?
What does Megilla's brother think?

He, Fortune’s child ; what was his wound,
What arrow bore him to the ground?

Ha! change your mind? No other price
Ι take. Whatever flame 's astir,
Thy ssame has no debasing vice;

. Is erring, yet you nobly err,

Nor need to blush. Corne, be not coy,
Trust me for silence. Ah! poor boy,
Ant worthy os a nobler toit,

What whirlpool did around thee boil.

Thessalian poisons who can cure?

God, witch, or wizard, none is sure:
From this Chimera, shaped in three,
Scarce Pegasus could bring vyou free.

ODE XXVIII

Ancnrras ’

OR sea and land, and countless sand,
Archytas, thou hadst drawn the lines ;
Os earth a crust thy mite of dust
Now hythe Matine shore confines.
