onuxlv] THE ODES OF HORACE 145

Coan purpleS, gems that blaze,
Will not bring thee back the days
Writ in annals known but past,
Of the time that ssed so fast.

Beauty, colour, gesture’s grace,
All are gone. Not this the face,
Not the passion-breather, she
Once that stole myself from me.

After Cinam, thou wert great,

Form and charm. But Cinara, Fate
Quickly took, and lest us thee

Grey and worn faesimile,

Old as a decrepit crow,

That warm youths might see thee su,
Scourging thee with laughter’s lash,
Once a flambeau; now an ash.

ODE XIV

VICTORY OF TIBERIUS

OW may the Senate, how may Rome
Such free award os honours give,
As that thy same through years to corne
Shall still in grateful annals live?
