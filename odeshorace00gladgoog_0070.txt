omv] rue onus or Honncss 49

Be hoary Inachus thy sire,

Or be thou risen from the mire;

Be rich, or poor, it boots thee not:
’ Unpitying Orcus casts thy lot.

All, all, we drive to doom. The urn
Discharges every Life in turn:

For every Life, or soon or late,
The boat, and endless exile, wait.

ODE IV

TO XANTHIAS

OURT a handmaid, Xanthias Phoceus?

'T is no shame at all.

Slave Briseis tamed Achilles,
Proud before his fall.

Kingly Telamonian Ajax
Slave Tecmessa moved ;
And Atrides, in mid triumph,

Captive virgin loved;

When before the Phthian hero
Trojan squadrons ssed,
Wearied Greece an easier conquest
Found with Hector dead.
