16 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boottl

See, trickling lrom the crags, the spray;

The winds are hushed, clouds melt away,

And, such their will, the billow's erest
Sinks down to rest.

And then? Shall Romulus be first,
Or Numa’s peace, or Tarquin's burst

Α Os pride; shall Cato be my theme,
ln death supreme?

The Scauri, nauus, ornis nse '

So lavish in the Punic strile,
FabriciuS, Regulus, prolong
My grateful song.

The ancestral farm, the modest Lar,
Stern thrift; these gave us lords of war,

Camillus and our Curius bare,
With tangled hair.

ln fame Marcellus like the trees
GroWS, noiseless: and, outshining these,
The Caesar-star, a moon at nights

'Mid lesser lights.

To thee, Sire, Guardian ol mankind,

The charge ol Caesaris consigned

By fate, Saturnian Jove! and he
Rules next to thee.
