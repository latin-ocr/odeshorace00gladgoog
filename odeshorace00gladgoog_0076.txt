onan] snt ones or donner: 55

Venus nay Nymphs untainted, smile;

And cruel Cupid, glad the while,

HeatS, on his whetstone red with gere,
His arrowy store.

Our youth grows up, by thee enthralled,

A bondage new: none, once installed,

Will godless madam's chambers quit,
Though threatening it.

Old thrifty fathers woe betide!

And mothers ; and the new-made bride,

Lest thou forbid, when husbands roam,
The journey home.

ODE IX

TO VALGIUS, AGAINST EXCESSIVE MOURNING

OT always do the rains descend
Upon the clammy fields, my friend
Valgius: nor with perpetual strain
Do storms disturb the Caspian main.

Armenia doth not always chill

With ice; nor on the Gargan hill

ln northern gales oaks always groan,
Nor weeps the ash for foliage strown.
