TO FAUNUS

HE scampering Nymphs be free to seare;
But, Faunus, through my sunny grounds
Steal gently, and my fatlings spare
Upon thy roundS.

The season's kid thy grace bespeaks,
The bowl oswine is brimming well,

,love's mate: the antique altar reeks

¹ With savoury smell.

Soon as December’s Nones return,
The llock from grazing pass to play,
Both ox unyoked and village earn

Their holiday.

Wolves prowl‚ with searless lambs around;
The leaf is falling from the oak;
The merry dilcher stamps, the ground
With triple stroke.
