“‘As harlot, for some barbarous queen.'''
Stood Venus by, and slily smiled,
And there, with bow unbem, was seen
To stand, her child.

Sated at length, ‘Have done,’ she said,
‘With petulant wrathl Thou shalt fulfil
On that once hated, noble head
All, all thy will.

‘A consort of high J0ve thou art.
Sigh not; great fortune greatly wear;
Of the wide world a mighty part
Thy name shall bear!

ODE XXVIII

TO Neptune's lestal day
What honour shall we pay?

Up, Lyde; that fine juice,
Old Caecuban, produce;
Thy proper tasks perform,
And take our wits by storm.

Thou seest the day descend,
Yet think’st it will not endo
