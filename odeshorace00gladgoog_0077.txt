56 THEODES or HORACE [Boon 11

Yet Mystes lost remains thy theme
Unchanged. lr Hesper rise and gleam
At even, or fly the rising sun,

Thy plaint, thy passion, still are one.

Did three-lived Nestor evermore

His lost Antilochus deplore?

Did king, queen, sisterS, lengthen so
O'er the young Troilus their woe?

Let weak repinings cease at length;

Sing rather the triumphant strength

Os Caesar, and his latest deeds

'Mid snow·b0und mountains of the Medes

Their river ssows with bated crest; ἵ
And the Gelonian of the west,

Shut by the bounds that Rome decides,
In narrower precinct tamely rides,

ODE X

TO LICINIUS

EITHER-always tempt the deep,
Nor, Licinius, always keep,
Fearing storms, the slippery beach:
Such the rule of life I teach.
