104 THE ODES OF HORACE [Rmxssl .

ODE XIX

TO TELEPHUS

THE years from Inachus you count

To Codrus, keen for Greece to die, ·
And then to Aeacus remount,
And sacred Ilion’s captive cry.

But how to purchase Chian old,
And how to make my water hot,
Where, at what rent, to bar the cold
In winter time, thou tellest not.

A cup to Midnight Ι design,

Quick, boy! to this new moon a cup,
And to Muraena: three, or nine,

Our ladles serve us ; mix them up.

The bard, that loves the Muses nine,
Will still his thrice three draughts obtain,
Though Graces three undraped combine,
And would our cups to three restrain

For sear of brawls. The hour is ripe:
To madness for a moment fall,
Strike up the Berecynthian pipe,

‘ ’ Fetch lyre and fife from off the wall.'
