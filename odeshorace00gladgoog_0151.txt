And culture firmer tissue gain;
When conduct ceases to uplif , .

The statues of their gods erect.

‘Ye deer, of ravening wolves the prey,
Pursue not. What can best befal
Is but to sculk and flee away. ”

Right through to the Ausonian shore
Its gods, from Ilion fired and lost,
Its infants and its greybeards bore.
