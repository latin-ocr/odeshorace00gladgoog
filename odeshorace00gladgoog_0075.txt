THE ODES OF HORACE [Βοοκ 11

lts persumes let that shell resign;
Fill tankards bright, thy toils to drown
ln Massic: who shall quickest twine
¹The parsley 0r the myrtle crown?

Whom shall the die ol Venus tell,
To rule the feast? My bacchic stram
Shall match the Edons’. Aye, 't is well
To rave; our friend is home again.

ODE VlIl

το· Bnmnh

ADST thou but once, Barine, borne
A penalty lor vows sorsworn,
One tooth less white, or, seen to fail
One single nail,

I might believe. But, more and more,

Just when thy tongue most salsely swore,
Our youth are slaveS, 'thy beauty rare
A public care.

Thy mother's ashes ; night’s dumb sky;

The gods, that never chill, nor die ;

Whole heaven; it answerS, is on all,
Thou salsely call.
