Ona IV] THE ODES OF HORACE 129

He grew apace; his rushing might,
Swept headlong on the helpless doch,

Theo, keen with hunger and for fight,
On stalwart dragons drove the shock.

And, as in gladsome meads astray ,
Some kid the lion's whelp may spy,
lts tawny dam had weaned today,
So soon by new-set fang to die,

Vindelic hordes have Drusus seen,

And Rhaetian, on their Alpine trackS,
Whose use from earliest eld hath been
To fight with Amazonian axe.

How came it? This, and much beside,
We know not. Victors long and far,
Their bands now fled in headlong tide
From youthful skill and Roman war.

They learned how well, with omens kind,
Our youth their sense and spirit gained;
How Caesar, with a father's mind,
ν These Neroes in their boyhood trained.

The bold are children os the bold,
The ox, the horse by mettle prove
· Their kin: the savage eagle's mould
Engenders not the helpless dove.
