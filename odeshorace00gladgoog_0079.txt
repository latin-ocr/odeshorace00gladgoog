ODE XI

ro Qurnrrus mnenws

ΗΑΤ warlike Spaniards Quintius mean
Or Scythians, to inquire forbear,
For Adrian waters roll between:
Nor fret sor life’s small needed care.

Smooth youth recedes with ebbing tide,
And beauty; soon the greybeard's day,
To sport of frolic loves denied,
Drives easy slumbers far away.

No ssowers in constant form remain,
. The Moons with changing horn revolve,
Nor can the mind's exhausted strain

The problem of ‘sor ever' solve.

Nay rather, under plane or pine

At random stretch ; our whitening hairS,
While yet we may, with roses twine ;

Let Bacchus chase our biting cares

Assyrian unguent for the head,

Quick‚ boy! and let the wine be quaffed ;
Go temper in the river's bed

The fire of this Falernian draught.
