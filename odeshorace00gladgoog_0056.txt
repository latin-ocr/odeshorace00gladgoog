0011 ΧΧΧ] THE ODES OF HORACE

What virgin, with her lover killed,

Wilt have for slave? What persumed boy,

His father's bow once deftly skilled
And Seric arrows to employ?

And surely none will now deny

'That downward streams may upward glide
Upon the mountains; or desy

Old Tiber to reverse his tide ;

When thou, how changed! 101 mailed coat,
Surrendering 011 thy gathered store,

Wilt give the books Panaetius wrote
And rolls 01 Academic lore.

ODE XXX

TO VENUS

UIT Paphos ; Cnidos, Cyprus quit,
O Venus! Glycera calls thee, come ;

The incense fire is duly lit,
And 1011 her horne.

With thee, loose·girdled Graces come
And Nymphs, and Cupid glowing warm,
And Mercury‚ and Youth, to whom
Thou lend'st his charrn.
