Onu XXX] THE ODES OF HORACE ' 121

Not all ol me shall die: my praise ³
shall grOW, and never end.

While pontilf and mute vestal shall
the Capitol ascend,

And so a mighty share ol me

. shall Libitina loil.

Where bellows headstrong Aufidus,
where, on his arid soil,

King Daunus ruled a rural lolk,
of me it shall be told

That, grown from small to great, l first
ol all men subtly wrought

Aeolian strains to unison
with our Italian thought.

So take thine honours earned by deeds;
and graciously do thou,

Melpomene, with Delphic bays
adorn thy poet's brow. ⁸
