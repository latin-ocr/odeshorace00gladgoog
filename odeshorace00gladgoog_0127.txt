And then he cools in breezy air
His shoulders, spread with persumed hair:
Like NireuS, or the stripling torn

From Ida's boum.

ODE XXI

TO HIS CASK

ITH Manlius Consul came to life
Both I and thou: and, bring me jest,
Or spleen, or madding warS, or strife,
Or, kindlier far, a dreamless rest,

Call how thou wilt thy Massic wine,
’T is good to draw, this best of days:

Out with thee, then! Corvinus mine
For draughtS, no longer fiery, prayS.

Though in Socratic thought he dips,

He ’s not the man to leave thee fixed:
They say old Cato’s virtuous lips

Drew warmth srom wine, and wine unmixed.

Thou prickest on the dullard sense,
Yet gently: thou the wise man's soul,

And eounsel wrapt in reticence
Revealest through the jovial bowl.
