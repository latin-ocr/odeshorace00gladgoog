From inner nook a winso'me smile
Betrays the girl that sculks the while, ,
And Vkeepsahes, deftly filched by guile

From yielding finger, or srom wrist.

ODE X

TO MERCURY

RANDSON of Atlas, Mercury, ’twas thine,
The new-born man’s rude manners to refine,
By speech to school the mind, by gracious game
To shape the [rame.

Envoy of gods and mighty Jove their sire,

Ι sing thy praise, thou parent of the lyre ς

Α pilferer too, whene’er it pleased thy will,
With merry skill.

Thee yet a child Apollo threatened sore

Unless thou wouldst th’ ill-gotten herd restore:

But when he found his quiver too was gone,
He smiled anon. ‘

So Priam, carrying forth the Trojan wealth,
The proud Atridae and their camp by stealth
Eluded, and their watchfires all defied

With thee for guide. ¹

In seats of bliss thou lo'dgest pious souls;

Thy wand the shadowy herd of ghosts controIS,

Thou welcome guest, for gods to Hades given,
And gods of heaven.
