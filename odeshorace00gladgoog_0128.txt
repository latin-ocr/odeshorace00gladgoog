Onn XXIII] THE ODES OF HORACE 107

In drooping minds thou plantest hope,
The poor equipp’st with horns of might ;

Thou lendest thern a strength to eope
With thrones os kings, or soldiers fight.

Bacchus, and Venus if she will,

And GraceS, now with zones undone,
And rights, thy lawful season fill,

Till stars are quenched in morning sun.

ODE XXII

TO DIANA

F hills and groves thou guardian maid,
Who sav'st young mothers in their pain

When thrice invoked, and art arrayed
With threefold reign:

Long 0'er my villa lean the pine,
To which a sidelong-striking boar

Eaeh year Ι gladly bring as thine,
And shed his gore.

ODE XXIII
ro Pinnrni

F, each new moon, thy hands thou list,
To Heaven‚ my rustic Phidyle, .
And if thy Lar with persumed gift,
And grain, and swine, appeashd be,
