112 THE onas or nonncr [nooxm

So the wakeful Eviad's gaze
Hebrus Thrace all snowy white,
Rhodope, the mountain height

That barbarians tread, surveys.

I, these groves and shores around
Wandering, praise the Naiad King, ·

With his MaenadS, keen to ssing
Toppling ashes to the ground.

Mean and fleeting themes Ι scout ;

But well pleased will face the chance
“ Liber’s praises t0 advance,
And the wreath, his brows about.

ODE XXVI¹

ΟΝ CHLO'E

RST the maidens prized me well,
And Ι warred, and got me gain:
Now my arms and lyre shall dwell,
Scaborn Venus, in thy sane,

By the left-hand wall, disused‚
Torches, crowbarS, there Ι lay,

Bows and all, in heap confused,
Once so apt to break my way.¹
