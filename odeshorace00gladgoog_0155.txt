ODE VI

APOLLO, AND HIS OWN OFFICE As POET

POLLOi thee gross Tityus knew,
Thee the lost race of Niobe,
Os lying boast for chastener true ;
Achilles too had taste of thee,

O'er every soe victorious proved
Save only thee ; divine his race;
Troy tottered, and his lance, but moved,
Shook Dardan towers to their base.

Yet, like some pine the axe has bit,
Or cypress bent to eastern blast,

In dust os Troy, by Phoebus smit,
His headlong srame the hero cast.

He did not sculk, that horse within,
That lied profanely, to beguile
Those revels, and the people’s din
That neared its death, and danced the while.

In naked sternness he, ah! shame, Ι
Seized insants innocent and dumb,

Gave Trojan babes to Danaan flame, .
Aye, babes within the mother’s womb.
