34 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxl

Some handfuls, O thou shipman. So
When Eurus shatters at his worst
Venusian woodS, yet thou, thy goodS,

Shall live, thy profit stand the first;

All saved with thee, by Jove's decree,
And Neptune’S‚ who Tarentum guards.
, O fail not! lest thy sons, distressed
By vengeance which such crime rewardS,

ln coming day the forfeit pay ;
Perchance thysels the lot shall draw,

The debt of right thy lise may blight
To vindicate the losty law,

Be sure my word os prayer is heard:
No offering could thy guilt atone.
And yet l ask no irksome task ;
' Thrice strew the dust; and then begone.

ODE XXIX

TO ICCIUS

RABIAN gold now suits thy mood,
Friend Iccius. Thou wilt freely bleed

Sabaean kings, not yet subdued,
And bind in chains that dreadful Mede.
