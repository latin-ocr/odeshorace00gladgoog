My vow is not an idle vow;

Lead on; we breathe a common breath;
· As swom companions I and thou

i Will tread the road that ends in death.

Chimaera, with her fiery blast,
Nor Gyas and his hundred hands

N Shall daunt me, 1ο1 the lot is cast

. By Justice and my F ate’s commands

Let Libra, or let Scorpio,

My birth-hour's mightier portent, reign,
’ Or Capricorn in splendour glow‚
The tyrant of the Western main.

Our stars are kin in wondrous ways.
From rebel Saturn thou wert freed,
And F ate, when Jove's ascendant rays
Bade Time’s quick wings abate their speed.

The theatre thrice clapped you then;
Α My head that falling tree had broke,
But Faunus, guard os Mercury's men,
With strong right arm threw off the stroke.

Remember then to offer, thou,
The victims and the votive sane.
My humbler station will allow
To quit my dues with lambkin slain.
