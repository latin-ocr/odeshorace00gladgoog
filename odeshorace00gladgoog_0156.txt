onem] THE ones or Hoance 135

’T was but thy voice, with Venus loved,
Which gained from Jove the firm behest:
Aeneas should, when sale removed,
Build walls with happier omens blessed.

With thee the Argian song was born,
Thy locks the Xanthian stream bedews ;
Descend, Agyieus! never shorn,
Be champion ol the Daunian Muse.

To thee I owe the artos song,
The minstrel soul, the poet name.
Ο youths, and maidens, that prolong
The echo of your fathers’ fame;

Wards ol Diana, skilled to draw
The bow, o'er lynx and stag supreme,
Hold sast my Lesbian measure’s law,
My Lesbian time for Daunian theme.

Then sing aloud Latona's son,
And sing the Moon with waxing horn,
That speeds the circling months, begun
And ended, and that swells the corn.

Each bride shall say ‘I sang that song
What time the Jubilee returned, .
Dear to the gods, and not in vain
From Poet Horace aptly learned' Ἰ
