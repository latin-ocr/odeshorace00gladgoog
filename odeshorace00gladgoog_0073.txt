Grant rather for my rest in age
Tibur, th' Argeian founder's boast.

Some solace should my toils assuage
¹By sea, by land, in warsare most.

If crooked vFate this prayer hath banned,
Then would I seek the ssoeks skinclad
By sair GalesuS, and the land
That Sparta-born Phalanthus had.

It smiles forme, that nook os earth:
Its honey yields to Hybla n0t;

With green Venafrum's crop for worth
Its olive vies, that happy spot.

There spring is long and winter sost; '
Jove gives thern ; and, so Bacchus wills
Mount Aulon rears its vines alost,
And envies not Falernian hills.

Ἴ Let those fair towers us both content;

They call, we come. There thou shalt spend
Thy willing teardropS, to lament
·O’er my warm ash, thy bard and friend.
