ουκ xxv] THE oors or nonnos 111

Train we these minds effeminate
With thoughts and ways of manlier state.
Our highborn youth no'r hunts, nor rides ;
He cannot clip the horse's sides;

More apt the Grecian hoop to guide,
Or cast the die, our laws denied:
The while his father, rogue confessed,
Swindling his comrade, or his guest,

Heaps worthless wealth for worthless child.
Yes. Guilty gold is piled‚ and piled.

And yet the growing filthy stufs,

I know not how, is ne’er enough.

ODE XXV

TO BACCHUS

AKE me, Bacchus, filled with thee,
Where thou wilt: to grove, or grot,
Cavern, or I care not what,
So my theme great Caesar be.

He shall in the welkin shine,

Gain the ear of Jove on high;

I things great and fresh will try,
Spoken by no lips but mine.
