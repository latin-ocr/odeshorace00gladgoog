Onu XXIX] THE ODES OF HORACE

Of purpose, God all future doom
Wraps in a darkness thick as night,

And smiles in scom, if man presume
Beyond the boundary lines of right.

Hold fast the present. All beside ,
Shifts, as a shifting stream will now

Towrd Tuscan waters gently glide‚
Then hurl from off some craggy brow

Boulders and trees and flocks and sheds,
With woods' and mountains' echoing sound ;

As the wild deluge fills the beds
And bursts the margins all around.

Self-ruled, light-hearted shall he he,
Who daily ‘I have lived‚' can say,

Dark tempests let the Sire, decree,

‚ Or brightness‚ sor the coming day.

Yet cannot he the bygone ‹iays

Unmake, or hold the past undone,
Nor ean with utmost might erase

The work of hours whose glass is run.

Unpitying Fortune still resolves
Her wanton pastime to pursue,

Her honours here or there devolves,
Now favouring me, now helping you.
