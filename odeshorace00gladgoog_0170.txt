One XV] THE ODES OF HORACE 149

The Julian edict shall be law

For those who from deep Danube draw;
For Getae, SereS, Persian knaves, and those
4 Reared where the mighty Tanais llown

We,' wives and children all around,
With gifts of joyous Liber crowned‚

Will first invoke the gods with prayer and praise, η
On common and on lestal dayS,

Then sing to Lydian pipes anew
’ Deeds of old ehieh, as Romans dn,
And tell of sire AnchiseS, and the boy
Whom kindly Venus bare, and Troy.
