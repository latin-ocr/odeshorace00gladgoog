The unpolluted home is free from lust ;
Right laws, right habits,these have conquered crime;
The children’s likeness stamps the satheffs trust;
Quick justice strikes in time.

Who cares how Parthian, or cold Scythian, thrives
With what wild issue teem the German woods ;

Who 0'er the war, is only Caesar lives,
Os fierce Iberia broods?

Each, passing his own day at his own doorS,
Trains vines athwart his trees: the joyous cup
Then handles as he willa and thee adores
As god, in winding up.

As Hercules in Greece, or Castor, may,
So thou hast our libations and our prayers ;

Before our Lares we, our debt to pay,
Thy godhead blend with theirs.

‘Good prince, prolong our halcyon holiday:'

So we when sober, so when mellow crave,
Sober at sundawn, mellow when his ray
Has sunl( beneath the wave.
