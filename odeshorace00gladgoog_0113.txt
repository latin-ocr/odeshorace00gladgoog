92 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boox 111

Lvom.

The son os Ornytus inspires

My burning breast with mutual fires:
I’ll sace two several de'aths with joy,
’ So Fate but spare my Thurian boy.

Honscs.

What, if our ancient love awoke,
And bound us with its golden yoke;
If auburn Chloe I resign‚

And Lydia once again be mine?

LvolA.

Thou rougher than the Adrian sea,

And fickle as light cork, yet Ι

With thee would live, with thee would die.

HADSTf thou a savage mate a home upon
The farthest banks os Don,
Yet wouldst thou weep, nor leave me pining sore

To shiver at thy door.

Thou heard'st the creaking gate, the moaning trees
Between the palaces;'

Saw'st how, in clear-cold air of Jove, the snows
To icy coating sroze.
