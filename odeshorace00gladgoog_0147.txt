126 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boos 1v

And as a Matine bee dellowers
The fragrant thyme, laborious hours
Ι while away, and, large in care,

My songs prepare.

Touch thou a bolder lyre, what time

Caesar the sacred slope shall climb,

With laurelled brow, and, fierce in vain,
Sicambrian train‘.

Than whom kind Fate and gods in Heaven

No better, greater boon have given,

Nor shall, though Time's great womb unfold
An ageos gold.

Sing those glad days os public sports,
The end of strife, the emptied courts,
, Our Caesar once again at home
Through prayer of Rome.

Il I may speak what men will hear,

My voice, its best, shall swell the cheer,

‘O happy day': and loud proclaim
Our Caesar's name.

‘Io triumphe' all the town
Not once, nor twice, will cry, and crown

Thy march, and bounteous gods invoke
While altars smoke.
