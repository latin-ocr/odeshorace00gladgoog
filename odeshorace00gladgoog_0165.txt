144 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boon IV

How like you this? Be quick, and bring
Thy bargained share of offering ; ,
Would Ι could give thee drink for nought,

As wealth in lordly dwellings ought.

QuickI ere the lurid death-fire’s day,
Drive thou the lust os gain away!
Thy wisdom with unwisdom grace:
'T is well to rave, in time and¹ place.

ODE XIII

το ιγεὲ 1N nEcAv

YCEI me the gods have heard,

Made thee beldam at my word.
Still a beauty, thou dost think,
Saucy still sor sport and drink.

Though with creaking voice thou wo0,
Cupid lags: hath work to do

With young Chia’s blooming cheekS,
And her mouth that music speaks

Obstinate he passes by

Oaks dried up: he shuns thee ; why?
For he cannot wrinkles bear,
Blackening teeth, a1'1d whitening hair.
