onixvnr] rire ones or nomer: 23

The gods are with me; they approve
My muse, my prayers; come, see these fields,
And leam what blessingS, through their Iove,
The brimming horn os plenty yields.

Come hither, tune the Te'r‘an string,
In folded vale the dog-star shun,
Penelope and Circe sing
Both sick at heart, and sick for one.

Quaff too my harmiess Lesbian wine
Beneath the shade ; no Bacchus here

Shall fight with Mars, no evil sign
From saucy Cyrus need'st thou sear ;

Suspecting, hexrude hands and strong '
Might lay on thy srail form, and tear
Thy garment innocent nf wrong,
Or coronal that binds thy hair.

ODE XVIII

‚. ro Qurnrnrus vnnus

ESIDE the walls Catillus built,
On Tibur's soit incline,
ἲ No other tree, O Varus, rear
Before the 'sacred vine:
So may'st thou 'scape corroding care,
So leave ('t is Heaven's design)
All ills to those that shun the wine.
