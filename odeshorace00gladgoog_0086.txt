onnxvr] THE ones OF HORACE 65

--—-—..

Rest, asks the Thracian, wild in fight;
Rest, asks the Mede, with quiver bright;
But rest, my Grosphus, is not sold

For purple robe, or gems, or gold.

Nor lictor in the consul's train

Can stay the spirit’s piteous pain,
Nor wealth; nor drive the cares aloof
That flit beneath the pannelled roos.

A man, where shines on humble board ,
The salt-box that his father stored, ⁴
Lives well, though poor: no fears molest,
Nor greed os gain, his nightlyrest.

Why strenuouS, lor our little time, ’
To compass much? some other clime
Than ours¹ why covet? Wander why
From home? Ourselves we cannot lly.

Grim Care the knightly train attends,
Grim Care the beaked ships ascendS,
Outstrips the stag, and the east wind,
That chases clouds, leaves far behind.

¹'Eschew, with present joys content,
The mind on forecast idly bent:
Calm smiles the sourest chance can cheat ;

The sweetest is not wholly sweet.
