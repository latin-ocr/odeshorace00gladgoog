Bondsman new and ancient foe,
Late, Cantabria wears the chain;

Scythia, with unbended bow,
Thinks to cede her ancient plain.

Thou, no longer charged with power,
Though the State-ship somewhat heave,

Care but little. Of the hour
Crop the sweetS, the bitters leave.

ODE IX
noRAca nno Lvorn

Honnca.

· HILE no more welcome arms could twine
Around thy ¹snowy neck, than mine ;

Thy smile, thy heart, while Ι possessed,
Not Persia's monarch lived as blessed.

Lvorn.

While thou didst seed no rival llame,
Nor Lydia after Chloe came,

Oh then thy Lydia’s echoing name
Excelled e'en llia's Roman farne.

Honncn.

Me now Thre'r'cian Chloe swayS,
Skilled in solt lyre and solter lays ;
My forfeit lise l'll sreely give,

So she, my better lile, may live.
