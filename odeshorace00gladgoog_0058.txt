ODE XXXII

ms errr

HEY call sor thee. ln sport, in shade,
Thou, Ο my Lyre, some strains hast played,
Which yet may live. But now, inspire
A patriot fire.

ι Α Lesbian tuned thee first os all,
Armed, but in war’s brief interval,
Or when his wave·tossed ship might reach
The dripping beach,

Of Venus, and her Boy hard by,
Os Lycus, dark of hair and eye,

Os BacchuS, and the Muses,·he
Would minstrel be.

By Jove in banquet loved right well,

Apollo’s crown, beguiling Shell,

1 pray thee, let my fond ‘all haiII’
And prayer prevail.
