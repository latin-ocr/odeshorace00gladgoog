Onu 111] THE ODES OF HORACE 127

Ten bulls‚ ten kine, shall thee aequit ;

My means a call new-weaned permit,

Whose early days now sportive pass
In {attening grass.

As shows the moon but three days born,
Such homs his budding front adorn:
One spot of snow doth lustre shed‚

The rest is red.

ODE 111

το uripoueuh

IF with propitious eye, Melpomene,
A new-born habe thou see,

He never in the stress of Isthmian game‚
Nor lor Olympian fame

Will struggle ς nor shall War, with Delian leaf,
Proclaim him as a chief

On our high Capitol, for threatenings quelled ’
Of kings that had rebelled.

No: but from streams which fertile Tibur loves
And in thick shadowy groves

Aeolian song shall be his glorious choice.
Me too: the general voice ’
