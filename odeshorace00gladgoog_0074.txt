ODE VII ·

TO HIS COMRADE POMPEIUS r

¹OFT with me, where Brutus fought,
To straits reduced, say in what wise
Came it, that thou art safely brought
Back to thy country's gods and skies?

Pompey, my chief of comrades! thou
And I ost chid the lagging day

Beside the bowl; well crowned my brow,
My hair with Syrian unguent gay.

Philippi's headlong rout we shared,
I parted from my targe, not well ;
When valour quailed‚ and they that dared
To threaten loud, inglorious sell.'

Me Mercury in sable cloud

Safe through my foeS, though trembling, brought:
Thee backward to the eddying crowd

The war's tumultuous billow caught.

Come then, to Jove the banquet pay ; Ἴ
'T is due: beneath my laurel·tree
At length thy limbs war-wearied lay,
Nor spare my cask, ’t is marked for thee. ⁴
