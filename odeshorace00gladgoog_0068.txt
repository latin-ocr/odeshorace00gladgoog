Onull] · THE ODES OF HORACE 47

ODE ΙΙ

ΤΟ SALUSTIUS

O charm of silver coines to birth,
My Sallust, in the niggard earth;
Thou iov’st not what the mines produce,
Until it shine with ordered use.

Long, long may Proculeius 'live

And father's love to brothers give,
Borne up, by same that shall endure‚
On wings from melting ray secure.

Thou may'st a nobler realm control
By purging greed from out thy soul,
Thau is thou streteh a Punic reign

ι O’er Libyan coasts and coasts os Spain.

For the grim dropsy grows with· food
Uncured till, driven from the blood, ’
The cause hath ssed, and water swims

No longer through the blanching limbs·

The people‚ when Phraates mounts
The throne that Cyrus held, accounts
Him happy; but the wise deny,

And bid them cease the idle cry.

The crown and kingdom sase alone
They deern, the laurels all his own

Os him, that gold though heaped on high
Can pass with unreverting eye. ⁴
