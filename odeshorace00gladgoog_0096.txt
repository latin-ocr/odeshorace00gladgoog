ll Phrygian gem no pain can cure,
Nor purple robe os boundless price,

Nor wine of stock Falernian pure,
Nor choicest Achaemenian spice;

Why doors that might malie Envy pale?

Why build strange halls of height sublime?
Or why exchange my Sabine dale
For wealth that taxes toil and time?

ΟΝ ΤΗΕ OLD ROMAN CHARACTER

ET hardy youth in warfare dare
Robustly pinching want to bear;
The savage Parthian then shall sear ⁴ ⁰
Our ridens skilled to hurl the spear.

F ree air, and stir from hour to hour
Be his ; on him from foeman's tower
Some tyrant's queen shall bend her eye,
The sair young maid beside her sigh,

F orecasting sadly, lest her spouse,
Royal but all untutored, rouse
This lion fierce, careering o’er
Wild carnage and the field of gone.
