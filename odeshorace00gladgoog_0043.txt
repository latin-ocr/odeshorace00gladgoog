22 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxl

..w—u-

Curb thyself. ln olden time
Fever heat within me burned,
Tempted, and my youthful prime
To those hot iambics turned.

Gentle ways bewitch mie now,
Nothing charms that stirs to strife ;
Libels all 1 disavow ;

Prithee love me, give me lis .

ODE XVII

TO TYNDARIS

YCAEUS for Lucretilis
Ost nimble Faunus changing gives;
My flock os goats, 't is due to this,
From heat and rainsall guarded lives.

The shegoat flies her reeking mate
For arbutus, sar off srom sight,

Or devious thyme: nor fears her fate
¹From wolves os Mars, ¹nor adder's bite.

What time thy pipe hath told its tale
To the smooth cliffs that beetle round,
And all Ustica’s upland vale, ,
Ο Tyndaris, gives back the sound.
