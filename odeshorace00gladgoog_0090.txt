ODEXIX] Tim opes or normes 69

And how is this? Thou edgest on thy boundS,
Thy farm usurps the grounds, >

O greed! Jthat were thy tenant’s! Exiled, they
Plod, man and wife, their way, ’

And on the breast their fathers' gods, their care,
And squalid children bear.

And yet what home more certain, than the gates

-Of greedy OrcuS, waits ,

In Doom’s recess this landlord, and the gold
He can no longer hold?

just Earth to monarch’s child and to the poor Ι
Opens alike her door.

Astute Prometheus could not bend his guard,
Hell's tumkey, for reward;

He grips the sire of Pelops, and his line,
But sreely will resign,

Called or uncalled, the pauper, who shall close ·
His labours in repose.

ODE XIX

PRAISE OF BACCHUS

ACCHUS, the lonely rocks among,
(But who 'll believe me ἲ) met my view,
To Nymphs for pupils teaching song,

Goatlooted, point-eared Satyrs too.
