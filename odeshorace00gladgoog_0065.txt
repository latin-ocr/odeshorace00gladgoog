44 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxl

But she the coward’s death abhorred,
Feared not, as women sear, the sword,
Nor used the wings that ships provide
In some lone lurking-place to hide.

Bold to survey with eye serene
The void, that had her palace been,
She lodged the vipers on her skin
Where best to drink the poison in.

Then, sterner yet with end foreknown‚
She brooked not her defeat to own,

A glorious soul, nor bowed her head
ln haughty triumph to be led.

ODE XXXVIII

TO HIS SERVANT

FF with Persian gear, I hate it,
Hate the wreaths with limebark bound.
Care not where the latest roses
Linger on the ground:

Bring me myrtle, nought but myrtle!
Myrtle, boy, will well combine

Thee attending, me carousing,
’Neath the trellised vine.
