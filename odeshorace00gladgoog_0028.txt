onssrv] THE onas or noanon 7

ln nought, we think, can mortals fail:

We seek, like fools, high heaven to scale ;
With crime so rile, Jove cannot lay

The bolts, that speak his wrath, away.

ODE IV

TO THE RICH SEXTIUS

ARD winter breaks, O happy turn
to Zephyr and to Springl
Dry keels the rollers seaward bring;
ΙχἼῗοτ neither flocks now keep the stall,
nor lire the ploughman heeds ;
Nor whiten with hoar lrost the meads.
Now Venus from Cythera hies
the moonlit dance to twine;
The Grates and the Nymphs combine
With rhythmic leet the ground to srnite,
while Vulcan sweats to raise
Huge Cyclop forges to a blaze.
With flowers from soil hard bound no more,
to gird the gleaming brow
'T is meet, or with green myrtle now;
For offering now to Faunus bring,
beneath the shadowed grove,
Or lamb, or kid, if kid he love.
‘O Sextius Fortune's favourite, ,
the kingly tower alike
And pauper's hut pale Death will strike.
