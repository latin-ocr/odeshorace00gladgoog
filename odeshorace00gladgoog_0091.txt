ΤΗΕ ODES OF HORACE [Boox 11

Evoe! new fears my spirit scare,
Yet stormy joy my bosom thrills,

All Bacchic. Spare me, Liber, spare
Thy thyrsus and the stroke that kills.

Of founts which milk and wine bedew,
Of headstrong Thyads let me tell,

And streams of honey sing anew,
From out the hollow trunks that fell.

And next, thy consort's happy star
Added to heav’n; and, with the race

Of Pentheus, crushed in deadly war,
Lycurgus and his doom in Thrace.

Great rivers and barbaric seas
Thou rul'st‚ and, in some hilly spot,
The hair of those Bistonides
Welldrunk, thou bind'st with snaky knot.

The Giants wound their impious track
Athwart the steep of Jove’s domain,
But thou strong Rhoetus hurledst back,

With claw and fang os lion slain.

‘More apt for dance and sport and jest,
No fighter.' Such was rumour's course.
But now thy godhead stands confessed
In war as peace a central force.
