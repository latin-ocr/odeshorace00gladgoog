Onu IX] THE ODES OF HORACE 139

The sportive tales Anacreon told

Years have not blurred. Love cannot die,
And warnis t0·day, and warmed ο1 old

Th’ Aeolian maiden’s poesy.

Were there like Spartan Helen none
That loved thetrim adulterer’s hair, ι
The goldupon his vestments spun,
His train, his port, os royal air?

Was Teucer first to leam the use

Of Cretan shasts? Was Troy subdued
At once? Fought huge Idomeneus,

Or StheneloS, in solitude?

War is the Muse’s theme. Not first
DelphobuS, or Hectors rage,

For their pure spouses dared the worst,
Or did lor children battle wage.

Ere Agamemnon saw the light
i There lived brave men: but tearless all,
Enfolded in eternal night,
For lack of sacred minstrels, lall.

Test hidden baseness buried worth;

’Tis little odds. So, Lollius, l
Will set thy deeds and virtues sorth;
Too many and too great to die,
