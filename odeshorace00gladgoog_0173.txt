152 THE ODES OT HORACE

1-0—

Oh give us offspring, bless the tows,
Goddess‚ set forth in wedlock's cause;
Oh yoke our women, and command
That crowds of children deck the land.

The round of years, in order due,

Ten times eleven, brings anew

These chants and games‚ these sounds and sights,
Three shining days, three joyous nights

And you, O Fates‚ os truthful strain,
May firm-set laws your word maintain
Told once for all, and founded fast;
And give a future like our past.

May Earth, all blest in ssock and field,
Her wheaten crown for Ceres yield‚
And breezes light and healthful rains
Our yearlings rear on all the plains

Come hear thy boys, serene and kind,
Apollo ; leave thy darts behind ;

And hear the maidens as they pray,
Thou horned queen, whom stars obey.

If your decree hath founded Rome,

If, changing household gods and horne,
A remnant was ordained to reach‚
From Trojan plains, the Tuscan beach,
