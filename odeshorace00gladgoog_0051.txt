THE ODES OF HORACE [Boorzl

ODE XXV

TO LYDIA

ORWARD youths thy fastened windows

Rap not as they rapped of yore,
Force not vigils; and the threshold
Seems to hug the door.

Once it creaked on easy hingeS,
Less and little now ;

Yet l pine through endless nights, and,
Lydia, sleepest thou?

Thou, when lone and old, wilt suffer
Scom lrom jesting rakes;

Aye, ’twixt moons, when Boreas fiercest
From his mountains breaks.

Then shalt thou with flagrant passion
Like the beasts be torn,

And· with fire os cankered entrails
Thou shalt grieve, lorlorn,

That our youth must have their ivy
And their myrtle young,
All the withered leaves to Hebrus,

lcy Hebrus, flung.
