Our youth the civil clash shall hear,
(Αἰειε, through crimes of sires too few)
For Rome now sharpens sword and spear·
More meet for Persian hordes to rue.

Which god shall trembling Rome entreat
A falling empire’s weight to bear?
How vestals find petition meet
For ears, less open now to prayer?

To whom shall Jove the charge asslgn
Our crimes to cancel? Come at last

With cloudS, Apollo Seer Divine‚
About thy shining shoulders cast.

Or, please it thee, fairVenus, corne ·
To laugh with Sport and Cupid taught,
Or Mars, our founder, thou; if Rome
And thine own seed be worth a thought.

Enough of thine insatiate swoop‚

Thy game of shout, and burnished helm,
And the fell rush of Marsian troop

Their bleeding foes to overwhelm.

Or, gentle Maia's winged son,

If with an altered form content,
Deign to be Caesar’s champion,

Shrined in his earthly tenement.
