OonX] THE ODES OF HORACE

Golden is the middle state;
Love the middle gifts of fate,
Not the sloven squalid cot,
¹Proud and envied palace not.

Tallest pines must oftenest bend,
And the tallest towers descend ;
Heaviest fall from loftiest heights:
’T is the topS, that lightning s'mites.

Fear in good times, hope in ill,
Wise and well-trained bosoms fill ;
Angry winters come from Jove,

Jove those winters will remove.

Is it ill? lt may be well.

Silent once, a lyre may swell.
Phoebus stirs the Muse's wings‚
Or his bended bow unstringS.

Show thy spirit, when in straits ;
Couragel lf good F ortune waitS, ¹
And thou feel a toward¹ gale,

F url in time some swelling sail.
