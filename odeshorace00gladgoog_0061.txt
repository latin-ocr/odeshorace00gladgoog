40 THE ODES OF HORACE [Boorrl

ODE XXXV

TO FORTUNA

ODDESS, whose love is Antium’s crown,
So apt in lifting up to bliss
From low degree, or shattering down
Triumphal pomp to death’s abyss;

The pauper hind with ceaseless zeal
lmplores thee: and, since ssoods obey,

Whoever with Bithynian keel
Carpathian billows cuts away.¹

Thee vagrant Scyth, and Dacian rude
Dread, as they dread high Rome’s belrest;
Thee outland dames of royal blood,
Thee tyrants clad in purple vest.

Our pillar stands, By no ill stroke
O’erthrow it: lest the people’s rush

Should rouse to arms and so the solk
ln passion should the Empire crush.

Necessity before thee stalkS,
And holds within her iron grip

Hot lead and wedgeS, nails like baulkS,
And clamps no human hand can rip.
