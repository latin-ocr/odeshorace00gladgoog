64 THE ODES OF HORACE [Booxll

Myrtles abound, and violet-beds,
And every ssower, that yields a seem,
O'er olive-ground its persume shedS, -
That whilome brought its lord a rent. -

Dense laurel·shade shall stop the rays
Of summer. Ah! not such the rule
Of Romulus nor Cato's ways
Τοο rude, nor all the elder school.

Romans were poor: but yet they made
Rome greatly rich. No measuring then
With ten-foot rod the colonnade
Tow'rd the cool North, for private men.

The common turs ¹, that grew at large,

Those ancient laws bade all respect,
But freely at the public charge
With stone our towns and temples decked.

ODE XVI

TO GROSPHUS

HEN clouds the moon with blackness shade‚·
When stars refuse the sailors aid,
Caught on the broad Aegean’s breast
The shipman prays the gods for rest.

¹ The more usual rendering treats the fortuitus cespes as
material sor houses. 1 have taken the passage as a prohibition

ol encroachment.
